# EasyFix

The [EasyFix](https://github.com/redhat-openstack/easyfix) project is
the best place to find places to get started working on RDO. These are
tickets that are accessible to beginners, and not urgent, and so a
wonderful opportunity to learn how things work while dipping your toes
into the code.
