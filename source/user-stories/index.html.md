# User stories

User stories feature a number of projects that have successfully deployed an OpenStack-based solution using RDO.

### Submit your own user story

what components you have integrated and how you did it. You can [contact

at OpenStack Summit in Austin.

## CERN

![](/images/wiki/Cern.jpg) [CERN](http://openstack-in-production.blogspot.com/) has more than 100,000 cores running OpenStack using RDO for deployment.

> We use the RDO client packages on our Linux machines. The upgrade was a change of repository and yum update. --[OpenStack In Production blog](http://openstack-in-production.blogspot.com/)

## ThoughtWorks

> A co-worker and I have been spiking out OpenStack and out of all the Distro's available, without any doubt (obviously as it's from Redhat) RDO is the best for the following reasons:
> 
> 1.  Idempotent
> 2.  Best Documentation
> 3.  Helpful forums providing working solutions.
> 
> The work done on Packstack is admirable, this makes us to wonder why someone would want to use DevStack. --[ThoughtWorks](http://thoughtworks.com)

## Juanma's Blog: Deploying OpenStack with KVM and VMware NSX

> RDO is the upstream version of RHEL OpenStack Platform, the commercial version of OpenStack by Red Hat. During the last months I tried several flavors of OpenStack and while I still think that installing from scratch is the best way to learn, in fact is what I did for my first labs, RDO gives me the possibility to quickly create my testing labs. --[Juanma's Blog](http://jreypo.wordpress.com/2014/06/23/deploying-openstack-with-kvm-and-vmware-nsx-part-4-deploy-openstack-rdo-with-neutron-integrated-with-nsx/)

## OSAS test lab: Red Hat's Open Source and Standards team test lab

> *Deployment:* Red Hat's Open Source and Standards team runs its test lab on a mixture of OpenStack and oVirt nodes, running on Fedora 18-based hosts.

> *Use case:* We use OpenStack to host standing services for our lab (such as our oVirt management server), to quickly build up and tear down test environments, and to deploy staging and development instances for sites under construction.
