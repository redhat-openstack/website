For Red Hat Summit 2017, the RDO and ManageIQ engineers in the Red Hat
Brno office put together a mini-cluster, using Intel NUC servers, to
demo running OpenStack, and managing it with ManageIQ.

On the RDO side, we built with the following hardware.

| Item | Model/Type |
|------|-------|
| Intel NUC (4) | [6I5SYK](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/boards-kits/nuc/kits/nuc6i5syk.html) |
| RAM (4) | Crucial SO-DIMM 32 GB DDR4 2133MHz CL15 Dual Ranked |
| SSD (4) | Patriot Ignite M2 240 gigabytes |
| Cables  | Various CAT5E cables for connectivity |
| Switch  | TP-LINK TL-SG105 |
| Router  | (Someone fill this in?) |
| USB network adapters | [Axago ADE-SG](http://www.axagon.eu/produkty/ade-sg) or similar |


Note: The NUCs have only one NIC. The USB network adapters are to
provide the control network.
