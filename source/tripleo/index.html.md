# <a name="qs">TripleO</a>

TripleO is a set of tools for the deployment and management of OpenStack which utilizes the RDO repositories. The TripleO project was retired after the Zed
release of OpenStack.

The name TripleO refers to three related things:

*   A design pattern, where an underlying OpenStack instance is used to deploy and then to manage another, usually more complex, OpenStack instance.
*   A set of configuration files and scripts which contain OS image building rules and service configuration rules
*   The upstream program within the OpenStack project which develops the various scripts and utilities which are combined to deliver the complete software solution.

The design pattern utilizes a single-purpose deployment OpenStack which deploys and manages a more sophisticated, general-purpose OpenStack instance which is what
gives TripleO its name. TripleO is short for *OpenStack On OpenStack*.
