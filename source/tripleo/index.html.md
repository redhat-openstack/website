TripleO is a set of tools for the deployment and management of OpenStack which utilizes the RDO repositories.

The name TripleO refers to three related things:

*   A design pattern, where an underlying OpenStack instance is used to deploy and then to manage another, usually more complex, OpenStack instance.
*   A set of configuration files and scripts which contain OS image building rules and service configuration rules
*   The upstream program within the OpenStack project which develops the various scripts and utilities which are combined to deliver the complete software solution.

The design pattern utilizes a single-purpose deployment OpenStack which deploys and manages a more sophisticated, general-purpose OpenStack instance which is what
gives TripleO its name. TripleO is short for *OpenStack On OpenStack*.
