# Installing and configuring RDO

[‚Üê Docs](/documentation/)

For an initial test deployment, follow the [Packstack quickstart](/install/packstack). While using Packstack is sufficient as a proof of concept, there are other ways that you can use to deploy OpenStack with RDO. If you need to deploy a production-ready cloud, possibly with HA, see the [TripleO quickstart](/tripleo).
