# Installing and configuring RDO

[← Use](/use/)

For an initial test deployment, follow the [Packstack](/install/packstack) instructions. While using Packstack is sufficient as a proof of concept, there are other ways that you can 
use to deploy OpenStack with RDO. If you need to deploy a production-ready cloud with an OpenStack Zed or earlier release, possibly with HA, see the [TripleO quickstart](/tripleo).
