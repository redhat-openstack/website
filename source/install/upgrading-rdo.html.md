# Manual upgrades of RDO

RDO project currently doesn't validate manual deployments. There are suggested to use deployment tools like Tripleo, where upgrade procedure is supported and described in the [documentation](https://docs.openstack.org/tripleo-docs/latest/upgrade/index.html).


[Upstream instructions](https://docs.openstack.org/operations-guide/ops-upgrades.html) to manual upgrade may be helpful, however some adjustments might be needed.


For operating TripleO-based OpenStack environments, see the [TripleO documentation](https://docs.openstack.org/developer/tripleo-docs/).
