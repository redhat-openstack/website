# Manual upgrades of RDO 

RDO project currently doesn't support manual deployments. There are suggested to use deployment tools like Tripleo, where upgrade procedure is supported and described in the [documentation](https://docs.openstack.org/tripleo-docs/latest/upgrade/index.html).


For operating TripleO-based OpenStack environments, see the [TripleO documentation](https://docs.openstack.org/developer/tripleo-docs/).
