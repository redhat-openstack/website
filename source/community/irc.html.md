## Where?

Conversations about RDO happen a number of different places on IRC. All
of these channels are on Freenode IRC network.

* #RDO - Any general conversation about RDO, including developer issues
  and user questions.

* #tripleO - Discussion specifically of TripleO. This tends to be fairly
  technical.

* #trystack - Discussion of the [http://trystack.org/](Trystack)
  service.

* #centos-devel - If you have questions about the parts of the RDO
  infrastructure that run in the CentOS Community Build System (cbs),
  this is where you're most likely to get answers.

* #openstack - Remember that RDO is just a small part of a larger
  community. Questions about OpenStack in general, not specifically
  about RDO, should go to the upstream channel.
