# Workflow during the development cycle

While an upstream development cycle is in process, we package up what
happens each day, using the following workflow. TODO

For what we do once a release happens upstream, see [this
doc](/what/release/).

* [Overview and infrastructure](/what/workflow-overview)
* [DLRN: what it is, what we use it for](/what/dlrn)
* [RDO Trunk repos](/what/trunk-repos)
* [Promotion pipeline](/what/promotion-pipeline)
* [I want a new package in RDO, now what?](/what/new-package)
