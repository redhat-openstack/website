# CentOS

RDO is the best OpenStack distribution for [CentOS](http://centos.org/),
because it is built and tested on CentOS, with the help of the CentOS
community. This work is facilitated via the [CentOS Cloud
SIG](https://wiki.centos.org/SpecialInterestGroup/Cloud).

The Cloud SIG has weekly meetings, every Thursday at [15:00
UTC](https://www.google.com/search?q=15%3A00+UTC).

The transcript from the most recent meeting may be found
[here](https://www.centos.org/minutes/2015/november/centos-devel.2015-11-12-15.10.log.html).
