# Ducks

In Paris, at the OpenStack Summit in 2014, eNovance were giving away
ducks as their booth swag. When eNovance joined the Red Hat family, RDO
decided to continue this tradition, and has done ducks each OpenStack
Summit since.

Here's a gallery of ducks from years past. (Please share your duck
images if you have them!)

There's a [blog post](/blog/2015/10/ducks/) explaining the significance
of ducks.
