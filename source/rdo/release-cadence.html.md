# Release-cadence

## RDO packaging release cadence

This page describes the release cadence of RDO packages in relation to different community distributions, giving an approximate idea of *community support* status of any given OpenStack release.

### Fedora

The OpenStack package maintainer team keeps only the latest OpenStack development release available for Fedora in RDO Trunk repositories. For more information, see:

* [https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/OpenStack](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/OpenStack)

### RHEL and CentOS

Due to the slower release cadence of RHEL and therefore CentOS, only the most recent release plus the previous one are supported, in keeping up with upstream policy. Older versions of the operating system such as CentOS 6 do not receive later releases.

|----------------------|----------|-----------|
| RHEL 8 and CentOS 8  | Ussuri   | supported |
| RHEL 8 and CentOS 8  | Train    | supported |
| RHEL 7 and CentOS 7  | Train    | supported |
