## Introducing RDO

RDO makes it easy to install and deploy the most up-to-date OpenStack on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and its derivatives.

OpenStack relies on the underlying operating system and hypervisor — and what better operating system to build on than the industry's leading enterprise operating system? The RDO community is the best place to get and share information about using OpenStack on Red Hat.

## Red Hat loves OpenStack

The OpenStack project has a diverse and growing community of contributors, but none match Red Hat's combination of production experience, technical expertise, and commitment to the open source way of producing software.

From the Linux kernel and the KVM hypervisor to the top level OpenStack project components, Red Hat has expertise at every level of the stack. Whether you want to run a proof of concept of OpenStack on CentOS, or you want to prepare a production cloud and you are evaluating partners for your deployment, who better to go to than the number one contributor to OpenStack?

When you're ready for production, and you want support from a partner you know, Red Hat offers you the Red Hat OpenStack Early Adopter Program, with its partner certification program.
