Why ducks?

Well, as everyone knows, sometimes, the moment you ask a question
out loud, the obvious answer occurs to you. And often, when
explaining a problem to someone else, you understand it better
yourself.

Red Hat has your back on this. We have ducks at our booth at OpenStack
Summit in Tokyo this week. The benefits of using a rubber duck as part
of your programming work flow are [well
documented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging).

So, come grab a duck, and learn more about RDO, in the OpenStack
Marketplace at [OpenStack Summit](http://openstack.org/summit/).
