Recently there have been some great articles appearing describing how to do some more complex things with OpenStack. Here are a few of them for your reading pleasure.

* [Auto-scaling with Heat and Ceilometer](http://techs.enovance.com/5991/autoscaling-with-heat-and-ceilometer) - an in-depth article on instrumenting VMs with Ceilometer and using Heat to auto-scale a service from Mehdi Abaakouk of eNovance
* [An introduction to OpenStack orchestration](http://www.zerobanana.com/archive/2013/07/30#openstack-orchestration-introduction) and [how Heat orchestrates your OpenStack resources](http://www.zerobanana.com/archive/2013/08/29#heat-dependencies) by Red Hat's Zane Bitter give a high-level overview of the Heat service
* For those following the very hot "OpenStack Core" discussions, you might be interested in Rob Hirschfeld's series [what is Core](http://robhirschfeld.com/2013/07/22/kicking-off-core/)
* For people using Swift as an object store, the experiences of Spil Games [using OpenStack Swift with lots of small files](http://engineering.spilgames.com/openstack-swift-lots-small-files/) will make for a good read

We also have a number of compelling new pages which have been added to the wiki recently! In case you missed them:
