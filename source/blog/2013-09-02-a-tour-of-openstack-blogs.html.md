Recently there have been some great articles appearing describing how to do some more complex things with OpenStack. Here are a few of them for your reading pleasure.

* [An introduction to OpenStack orchestration](http://www.zerobanana.com/archive/2013/07/30#openstack-orchestration-introduction) and [how Heat orchestrates your OpenStack resources](http://www.zerobanana.com/archive/2013/08/29#heat-dependencies) by Red Hat's Zane Bitter give a high-level overview of the Heat service
* For those following the very hot "OpenStack Core" discussions, you might be interested in Rob Hirschfeld's series [what is Core](http://robhirschfeld.com/2013/07/22/kicking-off-core/)
* For people using Swift as an object store, the experiences of Spil Games [using OpenStack Swift with lots of small files](http://engineering.spilgames.com/openstack-swift-lots-small-files/) will make for a good read

We also have a number of compelling new pages which have been added to the wiki recently! In case you missed them:

* [Using GRE tenant networks](https://www.rdoproject.org/networking/using-gre-tenant-networks/) by Bob Kukura describes how to create secure tunnels for your VLANs with GRE on RDO
* [Highly Available MySQL server on OpenStack](http://rdoproject.org/Highly_Available_MySQL_server_on_OpenStack) walks you through configuring Pacemaker and MySQL to create a HA MySQL server for your OpenStack deployment, by Dan Radez

* [Using Ceph for Block Storage with RDO](http://rdoproject.org/Using_Ceph_for_Block_Storage_with_RDO) will get you started using one of the most popular third-party storage engines, Ceph, as a back-end for your block storage needs - with thanks to Ross Turk from Inktank for adding the content here.
