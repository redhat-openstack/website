It can be intimidating trying to get involved in an open source project. Particularly one as huge and complicated as OpenStack. But we want you to join us on the RDO project, so we're trying to make it as easy as possible to get started.

To that end, we've started the [EasyFix](https://github.com/redhat-openstack/easyfix) initiative. EasyFix is a collection of "easy" tickets that you should be able to get started on without having a deep knowledge of the RDO project. And in the process, you'll learn what you need to know to move on to more complex things.

These tickets cover everything from documentation, to packaging, to helping with events, to writing tools to make things easier. And each ticket comes with a mentor - someone who has volunteered to help you get through that first commit.

There's also a [general mentors list](https://www.rdoproject.org/contribute/mentors/), categorized by area of expertise, if you just have a question and you're not sure who to ping on IRC.

We've been running the EasyFix program for about 3 weeks now, and in that time, four new contributors have started on the RDO project.

We're very pleased to welcome these new contributors, and hope they'll be around for a long time to come.

**Christopher "snecklifter" Brown** - *I'm Christopher Brown, a HPC Cloud Engineer based in Sheffield in the UK. I've worked on OpenStack since June 2015. I used to work on packaging for the Fedora project so I am transferring and updating those skills to help out with RDO when I can.*

**Anthony Chow** - *I am a software developer for legacy networking equipment wanting to be a Developer Advocate.  I have been venturing into other technologies such as cloud, container, and configuration management tools.  Passionate in learning and sharing technologies related topics.*

**Treva Williams** - *T. Nichole Williams is an RHCSA 7 Certified Linux and OpenStack engineer and content author for LinuxAcademy.com, & an OpenStack active technical contributor in the Magnum project. She is actively involved in several OpenStack, OpenShift, RDO, and Ceph communities and groups. When not OpenStacking or Cephing, she enjoys doggos, candy, cartoons, and playing "So You Think You're a Marine Biologist" on Google.*

**Ricardo Arguello** - *I am an Open Source enthusiast that tries to collaborate as much as I can. I have helped in the past with patches for WildFly, and as a Fedora packager. The RDO project is very complex an intimidating, but collaborators are welcome and there are easy to fix bugs for newbies to make their first contributions! That makes RDO a great community if you are interested in helping the project while learning about Open Stack internals in the process.*

If you want to participate in the RDO project, we encourage you to find something on the EasyFix list and get started. And please consider attending [EasyFix office hours](https://review.rdoproject.org/etherpad/p/rdo-office-hour-easyfixes), Tuesdays at 13:30 UTC.
