In April, Red Hat released RDO, a distribution of OpenStack Grizzly for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux and its derivatives, to make it easier for
users of these platforms to get started with OpenStack.

Now we're making it even easier to try out OpenStack on RHEL by making
it available on [TryStack.org](http://trystack.org), a publicly accessible cluster where
anyone can register and try out OpenStack.

[The x86 OpenStack cluster at TryStack.org](http://x86.trystack.org) runs on RHEL 6.4 and thanks to some awesome work from [Dan Radez](http://openstack.redhat.com/People#radez) we have recently completed the upgrade to the Grizzly release using packages from RDO. Red Hat has committed to the ongoing support and maintenance of the x86 cluster.

Head over to [TryStack.org](http://trystack.org) now to register for an account, and [try out RDO for your self](http://openstack.redhat.com/Using_RDO_on_TryStack).

For more information on getting started with RDO on your own servers, visit openstack.redhat.com and [download the packages today](http://openstack.redhat.com/Quickstart).
