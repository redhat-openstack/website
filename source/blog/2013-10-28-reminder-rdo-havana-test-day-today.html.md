Please remember that TODAY we're doing an RDO/Havana test day. You can get more details about what we'd like to test, at http://openstack.redhat.com/RDO_Test_Day_October_2013

Please take a moment to add your name to the list there if you're going to participate, so that we can have some idea of who's going to be there, and some record afterwards of how many showed up. Thanks!
