Greetings,  

I wanted to announce that the RDO CI team has begun to publish our results to the community.
The results of the CI system are available <a href= https://prod-rdojenkins.rhcloud.com/>here </a>.  Over the next few weeks we will be pushing out our results of additional openstack configurations like multi-node installations.  We are also working on improvements in the ability to gate changes based on the results of our testing.   We are focused on improving the quality and experience of RDO for the community.   Look for updates to the <a href=http://openstack.redhat.com/Continuous_Integration>Continuous Integration</a> page.  Any comments or questions are always welcome.  

Thank you.
