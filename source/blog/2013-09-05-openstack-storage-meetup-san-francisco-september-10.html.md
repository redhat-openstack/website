     Talking Storage: Ceph, Swift, Gluster, Architecture and Scaling
     Tuesday, September 10, 2013
     6:30 PM to 8:30 PM

      EVault HQ
      201 3rd Street, Suite 400, San Francisco, CA

What are the emerging architectural best practices for storage in a cloud? Does mixing compute and storage scale or should storage be its own tier? How about on-ramps for traditional enterprise IT storage teams to take advantage of new scale-out storage systems?

A panel with serious chops in Ceph, Swift and Gluster will be on hand to talk about features that are driving adoption, use cases, and how devs in the communtiy can participate.

Speakers include: 

* Sean Roberts, Yahoo! (moderator) 
* John Dickinson, SwiftStack 
* Joseph Glanville, Cloudscaling 
* Anand Avati, Red Hat (Gluster community) 
* Neil Levine, Inktank

We'll have food and drink, so arrive by 6:30 to get settled, and we'll start the program at 7pm.
