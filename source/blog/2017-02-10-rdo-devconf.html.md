It's been a very busy few weeks in the RDO travel schedule, and we wanted to share some photos with you from RDO's booth at [DevConf.cz](http://devconf.cz/).

Led by Eliska Malikova, and supported by our team of RDO engineers, we provided information about RDO and OpenStack, as well as a few impromptu musical performances.

RDO engineers spun up a small RDO cloud, and later in the day, the people from the [Manage IQ](http://manageiq.org/) booth next door set up an instance of their software to manage that cloud, showing that RDO and Manage IQ are better together.

You can see the full album of photos [on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/rbowen/albums/72157678032428192/with/32444478830/).

If you have photos or stories from DevConf, please share them with us on rdo-list. Thanks!
