Today, we are releasing OpenStack Grizzly packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 and clones,  and Fedora 18.

And to help you make the most of OpenStack, we've created this site so you can:

* Connect with fellow OpenStack users on the [community forums](/forum);
* [Get started](/install/packstack/) with the latest OpenStack project software, packaged and ready to use on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Scientific Linux, Fedora, and other RHEL derivatives and Fedora remixes;
* Read and improve on our [documentation](/documentation), check the [troubleshooting page](/troubleshooting/) if you have any issues, and consider adding your OpenStack set-up as a [case study](/user-stories)

If you have any questions, feel free to ask your questions here. And if you see a great nugget of information you want to share with others, consider adding it to our [wiki](http://rdoproject.org/Adding_new_content).   As always, it's the community behind open source projects that makes them great and we are excited to invite everyone in.

Thanks, and have fun with OpenStack!  
Dave Neary
