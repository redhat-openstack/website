I'm happy to annouce version `0.44.2` of [rdopkg][] RPM packaging automation
tool has been released.

While a changelog generated from git commits is available in the
[original 0.44 release commit
message](https://github.com/softwarefactory-project/rdopkg/commit/08a50f175e955c204ead625e2ae6ec2c0cb34005),
I think it's also worth a human readable summary of the work done by the rdopkg
community for this release. I'm not sure about the format yet, so I'll start
with a blog post about the changes - a **ChangeBlog** ;)

**41 commits** from **7 contributors** were merged over the course of **4
months** since last release with average **time to land of 6 days**.

## Software Factory migration
### [Migrate to softwarefactory-project.io](https://github.com/softwarefactory-project/rdopkg/commit/f76bbd6)

* `rdopkg` now has a 
[new home under software factory project](https://softwarefactory-project.io/repoxplorer/project.html?pid=rdopkg)
alongside [DLRN](https://softwarefactory-project.io/repoxplorer/project.html?pid=DLRN).
* Github repository also
[moved](https://github.com/softwarefactory-project/rdopkg) from legacy
location to `softwarefactory-project` namespace.
* [Issues tracker](https://github.com/softwarefactory-project/rdopkg/issues) stays on github.

## Versioning
### [Adopt pbr for version and setup.py management](https://github.com/softwarefactory-project/rdopkg/commit/efc76e8)
### [Include minor version 0.44 -> 0.44.0 as pbr dictates](https://github.com/softwarefactory-project/rdopkg/commit/da0c244)


## Python 3 compatibility
### [Add some Python 3 compatibility fixes](https://github.com/softwarefactory-project/rdopkg/commit/374c200)
### [More python 3 compatibility fixes](https://github.com/softwarefactory-project/rdopkg/commit/ef1e5d2)

* `rdopkg` now loads under python3, next step is
[running tests using python3](https://github.com/softwarefactory-project/rdopkg/issues/119)
using
[tox](https://github.com/softwarefactory-project/rdopkg/issues/134).


## Testing
### [Add BDD feature tests using python-behave](https://github.com/softwarefactory-project/rdopkg/commit/fc82a19)
* Unit tests sucked for testing high level behavior so I tried an alternative.
  I'm quite pleased with `python-behave`, see one of first `new-version` scenarios
  written in Gherkin:

      Scenario: rdopkg new-version with upstream patches
          Given a distgit at Version 0.1 and Release 0.1
          Given a patches branch with 5 patches
          Given a new version 1.0.0 with 2 patches from patches branch
          When I run rdopkg new-version -lntU 1.0.0
          Then .spec file tag Version is 1.0.0
          Then .spec file tag Release is 1%{?dist}
          Then .spec file doesn't contain patches_base
          Then .spec file has 3 patches defined
          Then .spec file contains new changelog entry with 1 lines
          Then new commit was created
  
  It also looks reasonable on the [pyton side](https://github.com/softwarefactory-project/rdopkg/blob/master/features/steps/distgit.py).

### [Avoid test failure due to git hooks](https://github.com/softwarefactory-project/rdopkg/commit/6a7798a)
