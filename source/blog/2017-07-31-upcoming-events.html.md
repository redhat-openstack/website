There's a number of upcoming events where RDO enthusiasts will be present. Mark your calendar!

## Join us for Test Day!

Milestone 3 of the Pike cycle was released last week, and so it's time
to test the RDO packages. Join us on Thursday and Friday of next week
(August 10th and 11th) for the [Pike M3 test
day](https://www.rdoproject.org/testday/pike/milestone3/). We'll be on
the #RDO channel on the Freenode IRC network to test, help, answer
questions, and propose solutions.

## Meetups

We encourage you to attend your local OpenStack meetup. There's
hundreds of them, all over the world, every day. We post a list of
upcoming meetups to the RDO mailing list each Monday, so that you can
mark your calendar. Or you can search
[meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/) for events near you.

If you're going to be speaking at an OpenStack meetup group, and you'd
like to have some RDO swag to take along with you, please contact me -
rbowen@redhat.com - or Rain - rain@redhat.com - with your request, at
least two weeks ahead of time.

And if you're a meetup organizer who is looking for speakers, we can
sometimes help you with that, too.

so that I can help promote your presence there.

## Other Events

The week of September 11 - 15th, the [OpenStack
PTG](https://www.openstack.org/ptg) will be held in
Denver, Colorado. At this event, project teams will meet to determine
what features will be worked on for the upcoming [Queens
release](https://releases.openstack.org/queens/schedule.html). Rich
Bowen will be there conducting video interviews, like [last
time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kT-Sv3rkTw&list=PLOuHvpVx7kYksG0NFaCaQsSkrUlj3Oq4S),
where OpenStack developers will be talking about what they worked on in
Pike, and what to expect for Queens. If you'll be there, watch the
announcements from the OpenStack foundation for how to sign up for an
interview slot.

On October 20th, we'll be joining up with the CentOS community at the
CentOS Dojo at CERN. Details of that event may be found [on the CERN
website](https://indico.cern.ch/event/649159/overview). CERN is located
just north of Geneva. The event is expected to have a number of RDO
developers in attendance, as CERN has one of the largest OpenStack
deployments in the world, running on RDO.

Other RDO events, including the many OpenStack meetups around the
world, are always listed on the [RDO events page](http://rdoproject.org/events).
If you have an RDO-related event, please feel free to add it by submitting a pull
request [on Github](https://github.com/OSAS/rh-events/blob/master/2016/RDO-Meetups.yml).
