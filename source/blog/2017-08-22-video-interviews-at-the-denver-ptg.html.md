TL;DR: [Sign up here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KNHuo9Yb5kbjZAYGQ_PAo-YFndD8QTdaKzaPoct_aaU/edit#gid=0) for the video interviews at the PTG in Denver next month.

Earlier this year, at the [PTG in Atlanta](https://www.openstack.org/ptg) I did video interviews with some of  the Red Hat engineering who were there.

You can see these videos on the [RDO YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/RDOCommunity).

Or you can see the teaser video here:

This year, I'll be expanding that to everyone - not just Red Hat - to emphasize the awesome cooperation and collaboration that happens across projects, and across companies.

If you'll be at the PTG, please consider signing up to talk to me about your project. I'll be conducting interviews starting on Tuesday morning, and [you can sign up here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KNHuo9Yb5kbjZAYGQ_PAo-YFndD8QTdaKzaPoct_aaU/edit#gid=0)

Please see the "planning for your interview" tab of that spreadsheet for the answers to all of your questions about the interviews. Or contact me directly at rbowen AT red hat DOT com if you have more questions.
