Several weeks ago I attended the Project Teams Gathering (PTG) in Denver, and conducted a number of interviews with project teams and a few of the PTLs (Project Technical Leads).

These interviews are now all up on the [RDO YouTube channel](http://youtube.com/RDOCommunity). Please subscribe, as I'll be doing more interviews like this at OpenStack Summit in Sydney, as well as at future events.

I want to draw particular attention to my [interview with the Swift crew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7UmrNJ80qc) about how they collaborate across company lines and across timezones. Very inspiring.
