**Trick to test external ceph clusters using only tripleo-quickstart** by John

> TripleO can stand up a Ceph cluster as part of an overcloud. However, if all you have  is a tripleo-quickstart env and want to test an overcloud feature which uses an external Ceph cluster, then  can have quickstart stand up two heat stacks, one to make a separate ceph  cluster and the other to stand up an overcloud which uses that ceph cluster.

**Scheduled snapshots** by Tim Bell

> While most of the machines on the CERN cloud are configured using Puppet with state stored in external databases or file stores, there are a few machines where this has been difficult, especially for legacy applications.
