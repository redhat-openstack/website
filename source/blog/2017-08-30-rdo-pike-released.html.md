The RDO community is pleased to announce the general availability of the RDO build for OpenStack Pike for RPM-based distributions, CentOS Linux 7 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
RDO is suitable for building private, public, and hybrid clouds. Pike is the 16th release from the [OpenStack project](http://openstack.org), which is the work of more than 2300 contributors from around the world ([source](http://stackalytics.com/)).

The release is making its way out to the CentOS mirror network, and should be on your favorite mirror site momentarily.

The [RDO community project](https://www.rdoproject.org/) curates, packages, builds, tests and maintains a complete OpenStack component set for RHEL and CentOS Linux and is a member of the [CentOS Cloud Infrastructure SIG](https://wiki.centos.org/SpecialInterestGroup/Cloud).
The Cloud Infrastructure SIG focuses on delivering a great user experience for CentOS Linux users looking to build and maintain their own on-premise, public or hybrid clouds.

All work on RDO, and on the downstream release, Red Hat OpenStack Platform, is 100% open source, with all code changes going upstream first.

## New and Improved

Interesting things in the Pike release include:

- [Ironic](https://github.com/openstack/ironic) now supports [booting from Cinder volumes](https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/pike/admin/boot-from-volume.html), [rolling upgrades](https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/pike/admin/upgrade-guide.html#rolling-upgrades) and [Redfish protocol](https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/pike/admin/drivers/redfish.html).
- We added OVN support to Packstack.
- We added support to install the Horizon plugins for several services in Packstack.

## Getting Started

There are three ways to get started with RDO.

- To spin up a proof of concept cloud, quickly, and on limited hardware, try an [All-In-One Packstack](https://www.rdoproject.org/install/packstack/) installation. You can run RDO on a single node to get a feel for how it works.
- For a production deployment of RDO, use the [TripleO Quickstart](https://www.rdoproject.org/tripleo/) and you'll be running a production cloud in short order.
- Finally, if you want to try out OpenStack, but don't have the time or hardware to run it yourself, visit [TryStack](http://trystack.org/), where you can use a free public OpenStack instance, running RDO packages, to experiment with the OpenStack management interface and API, launch instances, configure networks, and generally familiarize yourself with OpenStack. (TryStack is not, at this time, running Pike, although it is running RDO.)


## Getting Help
    
The RDO Project participates in a Q&A service at [ask.openstack.org](http://ask.openstack.org), for more developer-oriented content we recommend joining the [rdo-list mailing list](https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/rdo-list). Remember to post a brief introduction about yourself and your RDO story. You can also find extensive documentation on the [RDO docs site](https://www.rdoproject.org/use).

The #rdo channel on Freenode IRC is also an excellent place to find help and give help.

We also welcome comments and requests on the [CentOS mailing lists](https://lists.centos.org/) and the CentOS and TripleO IRC channels (#centos, #centos-devel, and #tripleo on irc.freenode.net), however we have a more focused audience in the RDO venues.


## Getting Involved

To get involved in the OpenStack RPM packaging effort, see the [RDO community pages](https://www.rdoproject.org/contribute/) and the [CentOS Cloud SIG page](https://wiki.centos.org/SpecialInterestGroup/Cloud). See also the [RDO packaging documentation](https://www.rdoproject.org/packaging/).

Join us in #rdo on the Freenode IRC network, and follow us at [@RDOCommunity](http://twitter.com/rdocommunity) on Twitter. If you prefer Facebook, [we're there too](http://facebook.com/rdocommunity), and also [Google+](http://tm3.org/rdogplus).
