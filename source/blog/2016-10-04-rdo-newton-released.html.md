The RDO community is pleased to announce the general availability of the RDO build for OpenStack Newton for RPM-based distributions, CentOS Linux 7 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux. RDO is suitable for building private, public, and hybrid clouds. Newton is the 14th release from the [OpenStack project](http://openstack.org), which is the work of more than 2700 contributors from around the world ([source](http://stackalytics.com/)).

The [RDO community project](https://www.rdoproject.org/) curates, packages, builds, tests, and maintains a complete OpenStack component set for RHEL and CentOS Linux and is a member of the [CentOS Cloud Infrastructure SIG](https://wiki.centos.org/SpecialInterestGroup/Cloud). The Cloud Infrastructure SIG focuses on delivering a great user experience for CentOS Linux users looking to build and maintain their own on-premise, public or hybrid clouds. At latest count, RDO contains [1157 packages](https://www.rdoproject.org/documentation/package-list/).

All work on RDO, and on the downstream release, Red Hat OpenStack Platform, is 100% open source, with all code changes going upstream first. 


**Getting Started**

There are three ways to get started with RDO.

To spin up a proof of concept cloud, quickly, and on limited hardware, try the [All-In-One Quickstart](http://rdoproject.org/Quickstart). You can run RDO on a single node to get a feel for how it works.

For a production deployment of RDO, use the [TripleO Quickstart](https://www.rdoproject.org/tripleo/) and you'll be running a production cloud in short order.

Finally, if you want to try out OpenStack, but don't have the time or hardware to run it yourself, visit [TryStack](http://trystack.org/), where you can use a free public OpenStack instance, running RDO packages, to experiment with the OpenStack management interface and API, launch instances, configure networks, and generally familiarize yourself with OpenStack


**Getting Help**
    
The RDO Project participates in a Q&A service at [ask.openstack.org](http://ask.openstack.org), for more developer-oriented content we recommend joining the [rdo-list mailing list](https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/rdo-list). Remember to post a brief introduction about yourself and your RDO story. You can also find extensive documentation on the [RDO docs site](https://www.rdoproject.org/documentation).

The #rdo channel on Freenode IRC is also an excellent place to find help and give help.

We also welcome comments and requests on the [CentOS mailing lists](https://lists.centos.org/) and the CentOS and TripleO IRC channels (#centos, #centos-devel, and #tripleo on irc.freenode.net), however we have a more focused audience in the RDO venues.


**Getting Involved**

To get involved in the OpenStack RPM packaging effort, see the [RDO community pages](https://www.rdoproject.org/community/) and the [CentOS Cloud SIG page](https://wiki.centos.org/SpecialInterestGroup/Cloud). See also the [RDO packaging documentation](https://www.rdoproject.org/packaging/).
