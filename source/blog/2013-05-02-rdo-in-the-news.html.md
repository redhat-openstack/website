Since launching on April 15th, RDO has garnered a lot of attention - both in press and in blogs and podcasts. Here's a review of what's been happening in the RDO world.

## Podcast: RDO at the OpenStack Summit

In Portland during [the OpenStack Summit](https://www.openstack.org/summit/portland-2013/) Dave Neary sat down with Richard Morrell of Red hat to record a podcast, covering questions like "what is RDO?", "who is it for?" "why are Red Hat releasing a community distribution of OpenStack?"

Hear the answers to these questions and more [at the Cloud Evangelist website](http://cloudevangelist.org/2013/04/17/podcast-openstack-developer-summit-2013/)

## OpenStack Summit review

Jason Brooks from the RDO team [wrote up his experiences](http://community.redhat.com/blog/2013/05/openstack-summit-highlights-amazing-open-source-outcomes/) from the OpenStack Summit and the RDO launch.

> What impressed me more than the growth of the project, however, was the way that
> OpenStack embodies one of things I love most about open source, namely, its knack
> for helping people to peel back or eliminate barriers to innovation. The more
> freedom we afford ourselves to experiment with and improve the systems we care
> about, the more amazing results we can achieve.
