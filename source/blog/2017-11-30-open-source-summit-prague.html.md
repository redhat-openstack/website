In October, RDO had a small presence at the [Open Source Summit](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/archive/2017/open-source-summit-europe-/)
(formerly known as LinuxCon) in Prague, Czechia.

While this event does not traditionally draw a big OpenStack audience, we were treated to a great talk by [Monty Taylor on Zuul](http://sched.co/BxI5), and
Fatih Degirmenci gave [an interesting talk on cross-community CI](http://sched.co/CVQM), in which he discussed the joint
work between the OpenStack and OpenDaylight communities to help one another verify cross-project
functionality.

On one of the evenings, members of the Fedora and CentOS community met in a BoF (Birds
of a Feather) meeting, to discuss how the projects relate, and how some of the load - including
the CI work that RDO does in the CentOS infrastructure - can better be shared between the two
projects to reduce duplication of effort.

This event is always a great place to interact with other open source enthusiasts. While, in the past, it was very Linux-centric, the event this year had a rather broader scope, and so drew people from many more communities.

Upcoming Open Source Summits will be held in Japan (June 20-22, 2018), Vancouver (August 29-31, 2018) and Edinburgh (October 22-24, 2018), and we expect to have a presence of some kind at each of these events.
