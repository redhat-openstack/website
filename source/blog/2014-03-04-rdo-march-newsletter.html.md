**RDO Newsletter, March 2014**

Hi again, and thanks for being part of the RDO community. We've got a number of events coming up, and various ways you can get involved in the RDO project, as well as the upsream OpenStack community, but first, a little bit about what happened since the last time I wrote.

**February events**

Last week, Lars Kellogg-Stedman hosted a Google Hangout in which he talked about standing up a multi-node OpenStack installation using RDO and Packstack. You can watch that presentation at  [https://plus.google.com/events/cm9ff549vmsim737lj7hopk4gao](https://plus.google.com/events/cm9ff549vmsim737lj7hopk4gao) and the slides from the presentation, including cut-and-paste command lines to reproduce the setup yourself, can be found at [goo.gl/Yvmd0P](http://goo.gl/Yvmd0P)  Other past RDO hangouts can be seen at http://openstack.redhat.com/Hangouts along with announcements of upcoming ones.

When last I wrote, I was in Belgium attending FOSDEM. That event was fantastic, and a little overwhelming, with over 5000 Free/Libre/OpenSource Software enthusiasts descending on the University of Brussels to celebrate and learn about various software projects and the issues surrounding them. While there, I interviewed Ohad Levy, who works on deploying OpenStack with The Foreman, about his work. Unfortunately, I managed to turn off the recorder before we started talking, and I have nothing to show for it. We'll be having that conversation again over the phone in the coming days, and I'll publish that on the RDO website.

Additionally, I attended Configuration Management Camp - [cfgmgmtcamp.eu/](http://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/) - and Infrastructure.next - [lanyrd.com/2014/infranext/](http://lanyrd.com/2014/infranext/) - in Ghent, which focused on issues that are important to us in the OpenStack world - configuration management, automation, and monitoring.

Last weekend, RDO had a table at SCaLE - the Southern California Linux Expo - [socallinuxexpo.org/blog/scale-12x](http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/blog/scale-12x) - where we had steady traffic through the whole event, with people telling us how much they love RDO, and other folks asking a lot of great questions about OpenStack, and where it fits into the larger cloud ecosystem, including projects like oVirt and OpenShift, who were our neighbors in our booth.

**Upcoming events**

We are planning our next RDO Test Days on March 19th and 20th. We'll be testing the third Icehouse milestone in preparation for the final release of Icehouse on April 17th. You can find more about the test day, and sign up to participate, at [openstack.redhat.com/RDO_test_day_Icehouse_milestone_3](http://openstack.redhat.com/RDO_test_day_Icehouse_milestone_3)

We'll be hosting another Google Hangout on Thursday, March 27th. Flavio Parcoco will be telling us about the Marconi project - [https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Marconi](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Marconi) - what it is, what the plans are for the coming releases, and how you can get involved in the development of this new piece of OpenStack infrastructure. That presentation will be streamed live at [https://plus.google.com/u/1/events/ckjhm8rggnqvrnspftna845kubk](https://plus.google.com/u/1/events/ckjhm8rggnqvrnspftna845kubk) and also recorded there for viewing afterwards.

Finally, don't forget that the [OpenStack Summit](https://www.openstack.org/summit/openstack-summit-atlanta-2014/) is just around the corner - May 12-16th in Atlanta, Georgia, USA. The vote has just closed for what sessions will be presented there - many thanks to those of you who voted - and now the selection process starts, with track chairs putting together the schedule from the sessions that did well in that process. We should see the schedule published in the coming month, and then it's off to Atlanta. We hope to see you there. Red Hat will have a booth there, featuring demos of RDO as well as our commercial OpenStack offering. We'd love to see you there - get your tickets early to take advantage of the early bird rates.

**Stats**

It's always fun to look at the statistics around OpenStack. They shift so quickly, even from hour to hour, and it's exciting to watch the progress of the project by the numbers.

One great place to find statistics is the Stackalytics site - [stackalytics.com/](http://www.stackalytics.com/) - where you can watch contributions by company, by module, by release, or by individual contributor. Something I find particularly interesting, as a writer, is that the second most active module within the ecosystem is the openstack-manuals project. 7% of contributions are to the documentation, second only to nova.

For RDO-specific statistics, we have [openstack.redhat.com/stats/](http://openstack.redhat.com/stats/) which was put together by Bitergia, the same company that does the Stackalytics site. Here you can track who's involved in the wiki, the mailing lists, and the development of the code.

**Get Involved**

As always, a few reminders of how you can get involved in the RDO project.

The wiki, at [openstack.redhat.com/Docs](http://openstack.redhat.com/Docs) , is one of the best ways you can share your experience with the rest of the RDO community. Articles about getting various scenarios working, corrections or addenda to existing articles, or suggestions for articles that you'd like to see written, are all a great help to people trying to run OpenStack.

If you have questions, or if you want to help answer other people's questions, go to [ask.openstack.org/](http://ask.openstack.org/) where there are questions from all over the OpenStack community - not just RDO users - and answers from experts on a variety of aspects of OpenStack. This is the best place to ask your questions, or to find other people who have already asked your question and received answers and advice.

If mailing lists are more to your liking, the rdo-list mailing list is the place to ask your questions and help other folks out with theirs. You can sign up for the list, or make alterations to your subscription, at [redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/rdo-list](http://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/rdo-list)

And finally, you can adjust your subscription to this newsletter, or invite your colleagues, at [redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/rdo-newsletter](http://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/rdo-newsletter)

Thanks again for being part of the RDO community. We look forward to seeing your contibutions.
