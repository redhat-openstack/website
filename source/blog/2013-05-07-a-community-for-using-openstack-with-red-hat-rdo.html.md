[A new article on the RDO project](http://www.redhat.com/about/news/archive/2013/5/a-community-for-using-openstack-with-red-hat-rdo) was published on the Red Hat blog today, covering what is RDO, who it's for, and how it relates to Red Hat's OpenStack product.

> RDO offers a pure community-supported upstream OpenStack experience with the latest stable 
> release (Grizzly) from OpenStack.org, packaged, integrated, and easy to deploy on Red Hat platforms.
> 
> RDO is also intended to be a community—the best place to get information about running OpenStack
> on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Fedora, or their derivatives, and to share knowledge with other
> OpenStack users on these same platforms. openstack.redhat.com is the best place to interact with
> other OpenStack users using Red Hat operating systems, and get access to the best information,
> answers, and community support focused on getting RDO running in your environment.
