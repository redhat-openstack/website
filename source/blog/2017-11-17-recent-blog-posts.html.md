It's been a little while since we've posted a roundup of blogposts around RDO, and you all have been rather prolific in the past month!

Here's what we as a community have been talking about:

**Hooroo! Australia bids farewell to incredible OpenStack Summit** by August Simonelli, Technical Marketing Manager, Cloud

> We have reached the end of another successful and exciting OpenStack Summit. Sydney did not disappoint giving attendees a wonderful show of weather ranging from rain and wind to bright, brilliant sunshine. The running joke was that Sydney was, again, just trying to be like Melbourne. Most locals will get that joke, and hopefully now some of our international visitors do, too!

**Build your Software Defined Data Center with Red Hat CloudForms and Openstack – part 2** by Michele Naldini

> Welcome back, here we will continue with the second part of my post, where we will work with Red Hat Cloudforms. If you remember, in our first post we spoke about Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11 (RHOSP). In addition to the blog article, at the end of this article is also a demo video I created to show to our customers/partners how they can build a fully automated software data center.

**Using Ansible Openstack modules on CentOS 7** by Fabian Arrotin

> Suppose that you have a RDO/Openstack cloud already in place, but that you'd want to automate some operations : what can you do ? On my side, I already mentioned that I used puppet to deploy initial clouds, but I still prefer Ansible myself when having to launch ad-hoc tasks, or even change configuration[s]. It's particulary true for our CI environment where we run "agentless" so all configuration changes happen through Ansible.

**Using Red Hat OpenStack Platform director to deploy co-located Ceph storage – Part Two** by Dan Macpherson, Principal Technical Writer

> Previously we learned all about the benefits in placing Ceph storage services directly on compute nodes in a co-located fashion. This time, we dive deep into the deployment templates to see how an actual deployment comes together and then test the results!

**Using Red Hat OpenStack Platform director to deploy co-located Ceph storage – Part One** by Dan Macpherson, Principal Technical Writer

> An exciting new feature in Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11 is full Red Hat OpenStack Platform director support for deploying Red Hat Ceph storage directly on your overcloud compute nodes. Often called hyperconverged, or HCI (for Hyperconverged Infrastructure), this deployment model places the Red Hat Ceph Storage Object Storage Daemons (OSDs) and storage pools directly on the compute nodes.
