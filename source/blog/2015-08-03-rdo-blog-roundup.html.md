Here's what RDO enthusiasts have been writing about over the past week.

If you're writing about RDO, or about OpenStack on CentOS, Fedora or RHEL, and you're not on my list, please let me know!

**A Cinder Road to Active/Active HA**, by Gorka Eguileor

> We all want to see OpenStack’s Block Storage Service operating in High Availability with Active/Active node configurations, and we are all keen to contribute to make it happen, but what does it take to get there?

**From 0 to OpenStack with devtest: the process in details**, by Yanis Guenane

> Devtest is the upstream way to deploy Openstack with TripleO. In simple words it takes you from a fresh bare metal server to an overcloud (understand OpenStack cloud) up and running with a single script.

**How VMs access metadata via qrouter-namespace in Openstack Kilo**, by Boris Derzhavets

> It is actually an update for Neutron on Kilo of original blog entry
http://techbackground.blogspot.ie/2013/06/metadata-via-quantum-router.html 
considering  Quantum implementation on Grizzly.

**CPU Pinning and NUMA Topology on RDO Kilo on Fedora Server 22**, by Boris Derzhavets

> Posting bellow follows up http://redhatstackblog.redhat.com/2015/05/05/cpu-pinning-and-numa-topology-awareness-in-openstack-compute/
on RDO Kilo installed on Fedora 22 . See detailed instructions for installation here  http://lxer.com/module/newswire/view/216855/index.html

**OpenStack CPU topology for High Throughput Computing**, by Tim Bell

> We are starting to look at the latest features of OpenStack Juno and Kilo as part of the CERN OpenStack cloud to optimise a number of different compute intensive applications.

> We'll break down the tips and techniques into a series of small blogs. A corresponding set of changes to the upstream documentation will also be made to ensure the options are documented fully.

**8CPU Model Selection for High Throughput Computing** by Tim Bell

> As part of the work to tune the configuration of the CERN cloud, we have been exploring various options for tuning compute intensive workloads.

> One option in the Nova configuration allows the model of CPU visible in the guest to be configured between different alternatives.

**8EPT and KSM for High Throughput Computing**, by Tim Bell

> As part of the analysis of CERN's compute intensive workload in a virtualised infrastructure, we have been examining various settings of KVM to tune the performance.

**Simpler Road to Cinder Active-Active** by Gorka Eguileor

> Last week I presented a possible solution to support Active-Active configurations in Cinder, and as much as it pains me to admit it, it was too complex, so this week I’ll present a simpler solution.

**NUMA and CPU Pinning in High Throughput Computing**, by Tim Bell

> CERN's OpenStack cloud runs the Juno release on mainly CentOS 7 hypervisors.
Along with previous tuning options described in this blog which can be used on Juno, a number of further improvements have been delivered in Kilo.
