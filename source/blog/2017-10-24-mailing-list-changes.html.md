You need to be aware of recent changes to our mailing lists

## What Happened, and Why?

Since the start of the project we have had one mailing list for both users and developers of the RDO project. Over time, we felt that user questions have been drowned out by the more technical developer-oriented discussion, leaving users/operators out of the conversation.

To this end, we've decided to split the one mailing list - rdo-list@redhat.com - into two new mailing lists - dev@lists.rdoproject.org and users@lists.rdoproject.org

We've also moved the rdo-newsletter@redhat.com list to the new newsletter@lists.rdoproject.org email address.

## What you need to do

You need to update your contacts list to reflect this change, and start sending email to the new addresses.

As in any typical open source project, user conversations (questions, discussion, community announcements, and so on) should go to the users list, while developer related discussion should go to the dev list.

If you send email to the old address, you should receive an immediate autoresponse reminding you of the new addresses.

List descriptions and arhives are now all at [https://lists.rdoproject.org/mailman/listinfo](https://lists.rdoproject.org/mailman/listinfo). Please let me know if you see references to the old list information, so we can get it updated.
