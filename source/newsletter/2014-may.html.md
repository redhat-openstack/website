## RDO Community Newsletter: May 2014

Thanks for being part of the RDO community! Be sure to tell your friends and colleagues to sign up, at <http://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/rdo-newsletter>

We'd also like to hear your thoughts on how we can improve the newsletter in the coming months. There's a very quick survey (2-5 minutes) at <http://tm3.org/rdosurvey> Thanks!

### OpenStack Summit

Of course the big news in May is the OpenStack Summit, Juno edition, which will take place in Atlanta Georgia in next week. You can see the great lineup of talks and events at <http://openstack.org/summit> and it's still not too late to register. You'll have the chance to meet many of the RDO engineers, and attend 20+ talks by people from the Red Hat OpenStack team - <http://tm3.org/rdosummit>

On Wednesday night, come have a drink on us at the World of Coca-Cola, and rub elbows with the RDO team over hors d'oeuvres - <http://tm3.org/summitparty>

And we'll be in the Red Hat booth all day, doing demos of RDO, as well as Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform. Drop by for the Booth Crawl on Monday evening to tell us what you're doing with OpenStack.

### LinuxCon Tokyo

On May 20-22, the week after the OpenStack Summit, we'll be in Tokyo for LinuxCon Japan, Gluster Community Day, and CloudOpen Japan. Stop by the Red Hat booth to find out about the Icehouse release of RDO, and what coming in the Juno release later this year.

### Icehouse Release

OpenStack Icehouse released on April 17th <http://openstack.org/icehouse/> - and it's better than ever, with 350 new features contributed by more than 1,200 developers from around the world. To get started using OpenStack Icehouse today, go to the RDO QuickStart page at <http://rdoproject.org/Quickstart> and follow the steps. If you're already running an earlier version of OpenStack, the upgrading doc at <http://rdoproject.org/Upgrading_RDO_To_Icehouse> is the way to go. (See <https://www.redhat.com/archives/rdo-list/2014-April/msg00105.html> for the more detailed list of what's in those packages.)

Over the coming months, we'll be hosting hangouts to talk about what's new in Icehouse, and we started with a presentation by Steve Baker about what's new in Heat. If you missed it, you can still watch it at <https://plus.google.com/u/1/events/ckhqrki6iepg12vkqk5vnt7ijd0>

And in May, we're going to have a hangout about TripleO, and advances in OpenStack's ease of installation and deployment. Follow us on Twitter - @rdocommunity - to find out exact date and time information.

### New HowTos and Wiki Articles

The RDO engineers have been really busy the last few months working on the Icehouse code. With the code freeze leading up to the release, some of them had a moment to catch up on their writing, and we've gotten some great content showing up in the weeks since the release.

The following new HowTo articles have been added to the RDO wiki:

*   TripleO VM Setip - <http://rdoproject.org/TripleO_VM_Setup>
*   Using MariDB+Galera Cluster with RDO Havana - <http://rdoproject.org/MariaDB_Galera>
*   Upgrading RDO To Icehouse - <http://rdoproject.org/Upgrading_RDO_To_Icehouse>
*   Deploying RDO using Instack - <http://rdoproject.org/Deploying_RDO_using_Instack>
*   Setting up High Availability - <http://rdoproject.org/Setting_up_High_Availability>

If you're interested in contributing to the RDO documentation, just roll up your sleeves and get started - It's a wiki. Register at <http://rdoproject.org/forum/entry/register> and start writing. Or, if you prefer to write it somewhere else, just drop me a note at rbowen redhat com and we'll link to it.

### Welcome Ceph!

Last week we announced that Red Hat has agreed to acquire Inktank, the provider of the Ceph filesystem. You can read the full press release at <http://tm3.org/redhatinktank>

RDO welcomes Ceph to the Red Hat storage family, and we're looking forward to working more closely with the Ceph community in the coming years.

### Stay in Touch

Thanks for reading this far. We really want to know if the newsletter is worth your time, whether you read it at all, and what we can do to make it more useful. Please consider filling out the (very short!) survey at <http://tm3.org/rdosurvey> to help us make it better. Thanks!
