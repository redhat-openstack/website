### Happy Birthday RDO!

Just two years ago we started this effort to provide easy-to-install OpenStack for users of RHEL, CentOS, and Fedora.

Since then, we've gone from being entirely internally developed at Red Hat to having community participation from around the world. And we've gone from zero to being at the heart of one of the largest OpenStack deployments on the planet, at CERN, where they just recently crossed the 100,000 core mark on their deployment - <https://twitter.com/noggin143/status/578950445835657216>

We're so glad you're along for the ride, and we're really excited about the coming year, as our relationship with the CentOS community continues to strengthen, and we get broader community participation in the project.

### OpenStack Summit

OpenStack Summit is a little over a month away, and now that the schedule is published - <https://www.openstack.org/summit/vancouver-2015/schedule/> - you can start planning your week.

Here's a few sessions that we recommend for RDO enthusiasts:

*   OpenStack Horizon deep dive and customization, with Matthias Runge - <http://sched.co/2qiP>

<!-- -->

*   Lessons learned on upgrades: the importance of HA and automation, with Emilien Macchi and Frederic Lepied - <http://sched.co/2rGf>

<!-- -->

*   How Neutron builds network topology for your multi-tier application, with Sadique Puthen - <http://sched.co/2qcl>

<!-- -->

*   The Road to Enterprise-Ready OpenStack Storage as Service, with Flavio Percoco and Sean Cohen - <http://sched.co/2qby>

<!-- -->

*   OpenStack Compute 101, with Stephen Gordon - <http://sched.co/2qeM>

<!-- -->

*   OpenDaylight and OpenStack, with Dave Neary - <http://sched.co/2qc8>

But there's so much more excellent content scheduled, that it's going to be really hard to decide. So be sure you spend some quality time with the schedule ahead of time, because on-site it's going to be overwhelming.

Register today, if you haven't already, at <http://tm3.org/summit-register> , and be sure to drop by the RDO booth for your event-exclusive RDO tshirt, and our newly updated RDO OpenStack cheatsheet bookmarks. See you there!

### Packaging Updates

The RDO CentOS packaging effort continues to move along, and we'd love to have you come join us if you're looking for a way to get more involved in RDO. We meet each Wednesday at 15:00 UTC on the #RDO channel on the Freenode IRC network to discuss the RDO packaging effort. And we meet with the larger CentOS Cloud SIG group each Thursday at 15:00 UTC on the #centos-devel channel, to discuss the work that spans multiple open source cloud platforms, including CloudStack, Eucalyptus, and OpenNebula.

### Meetups

Every day, there's at least OpenStack meetup somewhere in the world. Each week I post the upcoming meetings on the rdo-list mailing list and on the RDO website at <http://rdoproject.org/Events>

If you're speaking at an OpenStack meetup, please let us know so that we can help publicize it. If you attend one, please blog about it, so that the rest of us can benefit a little too.

Some upcoming meetups that you might want to check out include:

*   Thursday, April 02 OpenStack Seattle Meetup: Getting the Most out of Cinder, Seattle, WA, US - <http://www.meetup.com/OpenStack-Seattle/events/219193094/>

There's lots of ways to stay in in touch with what's going in in the RDO community. The best ways are ...

Social Media:

*   Follow us on Twitter - <http://twitter.com/rdocommunity>

*   Facebook - <http://facebook.com/rdocommunity>

Finally, remember that the OpenStack User Survey is always open, so every time you deploy a new OpenStack cloud, go update your records at <https://www.openstack.org/user-survey/> so that, when Vancouver rolls around, we have a clearer picture of the OpenStack usage out in the wild.

Thanks again for being part of the RDO community!
