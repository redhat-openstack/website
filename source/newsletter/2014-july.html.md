# 2014 July

## July 2014 RDO Community Newsletter

With the first milestone behind us this month, and the second one coming up fast - <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Juno_Release_Schedule> - the Juno cycle seems to be speeding past. Here's some of what's happened in June, and what's coming in July.

### Hangouts:

On June 6, Hugh Brock and the TripleO team talked about what's planned for OpenStack TripleO (the OpenStack deployment tool) in a Google Hangout. You can watch that here: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol5LuedIWBw>

On July 9, 15:00 UTC (11 am Eastern US time) Eoghan Glynn will be leading a Google Hangout in which he'll discuss what's new in Ceilometer in OpenStack Icehouse, and what's coming in Juno. Sign up to attend that event at <https://plus.google.com/events/c6e8vjjn8klrf78ruhkr95j4tas>

### Conferences:

Also, in July, RDO will have a presence at OSCON, July 20-24, in Portland, Oregon, both in the Red Hat booth, and also in the Cloud track - <http://www.oscon.com/oscon2014/public/schedule/topic/1113> If you're going to be at OSCON, drop by to say hi.

In early August, the Flock conference will be held in Prague, Czech Republic - <http://flocktofedora.com/> (August 6-9). In addition to all of the great Fedora content, Kashyap Chamarthy will be speaking about deploying OpenStack on Fedora. - <http://sched.co/1kI1BWf>

Although the OpenStack Summit is still a few months away, be sure it's on your calendar. The summit will be held in Paris, November 3-7. More information and registration will be available in the next month or two.
