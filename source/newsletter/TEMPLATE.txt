## Blog Posts

## Community meetings 

Every Wednesday at 15:00 UTC, we have the weekly RDO community meeting
on the #RDO channel on Freenode IRC. The agenda for this meeting is
posted each week in a [public
etherpad](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/RDO-Meeting) and the minutes
from the meeting are posted [on the RDO
website](https://www.rdoproject.org/community/community-meeting/). If
there's something you'd like to see happen in RDO - a package that is
missing, a tool that you'd like to see included, or a change in how
things are governed - this is the best time and place to help make that
happen.
