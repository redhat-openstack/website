## Get started contributing with EasyFix!

Your first contribution to any open source project can be intimidating
and confusing. We want to help you get started, and welcome you to the
RDO community. 

To that end, we've started the EasyFix initiative. We're
collecting "easy" tickets in the
[EasyFix](https://github.com/redhat-openstack/easyfix) GitHub ticket
tracker. Each ticket describes a task that you can do to get started
contributing to RDO. It should also include the name and email address
of someone who is willing to help you if you get stuck.

Tickets are in a variety of areas, from packaging, to CI jobs, to
documentation, to helping promote events. Whatever your skills are, we
need you on the project. So have a look, and see where you can plug in
to the community.

## Upcoming Events 

In the next few months there's a number of places where you can meet up
with members of the RDO community.

### Meetups

First, we encourage you to attend your local OpenStack meetup. There's
hundreds of them, all over the world, every day. We post a list of
upcoming meetups to the RDO mailing list each Monday, so that you can
mark your calendar. Or you can search
[meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/) for events near you.

If you're going to be speaking at an OpenStack meetup group, and you'd
like to have some RDO swag to take along with you, please contact me -
rbowen@redhat.com - or Rain - rain@redhat.com - with your request, at
least two weeks ahead of time.

And if you're a meetup organizer who is looking for speakers, we can
sometimes help you with that, too.

### OpenStack Days

The following OpenStack days are coming up, and each of them will have
RDO enthusiasts in attendance:

* [Sep 14, 2017 - OpenStack Days Benelux, Bussum, NL](http://www.openstack.nl/en/events/)
* [Sep 26, 2017 - OpenStack Days UK, London](http://openstackdays.uk/2017/)
* [Sep 28 - 29, 2017 - OpenStack Days Italy, Milan](http://openstackday.it/)
* [Oct 17, 2017 - OpenStack Days Turkey, Istanbul](http://www.openstackdaysistanbul.com/)
* [Oct 18 - 19, 2017 - OpenStack Days Nordic, Copenhagen](http://openstacknordic.org/copenhagen2017/)
* [Oct 19, 2017  OpenStack Days Canada, Ottawa](http://www.openstackcanada.com/)

If you're speaking at any of these events, please get in touch with me,
so that I can help promote your presence there.

### Other Events

The week of September 11 - 15th, the [OpenStack
PTG](https://www.openstack.org/ptg) will be held in
Denver, Colorado. At this event, project teams will meet to determine
what features will be worked on for the upcoming [Queens
release](https://releases.openstack.org/queens/schedule.html). Rich
Bowen will be there conducting video interviews, like [last
time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kT-Sv3rkTw&list=PLOuHvpVx7kYksG0NFaCaQsSkrUlj3Oq4S),
where OpenStack developers will be talking about what they worked on in
Pike, and what to expect for Queens. If you'll be there, watch the
announcements from the OpenStack foundation for how to sign up for an
interview slot.

On October 20th, we'll be joining up with the CentOS community at the
CentOS Dojo at CERN. Details of that event may be found [on the CERN
website](https://indico.cern.ch/event/649159/overview). CERN is located
just north of Geneva. The event is expected to have a number of RDO
developers in attendance, as CERN has one of the largest OpenStack
deployments in the world, running on RDO.

Other RDO events, including the many OpenStack meetups around the
world, are always listed on the [RDO events page](http://rdoproject.org/events).
If you have an RDO-related event, please feel free to add it by submitting a pull
request [on Github](https://github.com/OSAS/rh-events/blob/master/2016/RDO-Meetups.yml).

## Community meetings 

Every Wednesday at 15:00 UTC, we have the weekly RDO community meeting
on the #RDO channel on Freenode IRC. The agenda for this meeting is
posted each week in a [public
etherpad](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/RDO-Meeting) and the minutes
from the meeting are posted [on the RDO
website](https://www.rdoproject.org/community/community-meeting/). If
there's something you'd like to see happen in RDO - a package that is
missing, a tool that you'd like to see included, or a change in how
things are governed - this is the best time and place to help make that
happen.

This meeting is for everyone - developers and users of RDO, but also
anybody that has any interest in where the project is going. So please
do come, and speak up!
