## Get Involved

There's a number of ways that you can get involved in the RDO project today.

We are currently conducting a contributor survey to find out what we're doing well, and what we can do better, in the contributor process. Please take 10 minutes to [fill out the survey](https://goo.gl/forms/3aygehBsvM8TCegI2) to give us your feedback.

Every week, hundreds of OpenStack users visit ask.openstack.org with their questions, and, of course, some of these are about RDO. As of this writing, there are [50 unanswered RDO questions](https://goo.gl/cl8wDn). Take a few moments today to look through them and see if you can answer one of the, or point the questioner to a solution previously provided.

Also each week, Chandan Kumar posts the open ticket summary to the rdo-list mailing list. You can see the latest report [in the archive](https://www.redhat.com/archives/rdo-list/2017-April/msg00010.html). The list is categorized by component, so you can jump directly to the section that you would like to work on, and find issues waiting for attention.

In our ongoing effort to make it easier for people to contribute to RDO, we've expanded the "what we do" documentation, at [https://www.rdoproject.org/what/](https://www.rdoproject.org/what/), to include what we'd like to be there. If you encounter a document in that area that has a *todo* notice on it, and it's something you know about, click the "Edit on Github" link at the top right and start writing.

Or, just stop by to chat. We're always on #rdo on Freenode, and the more people we have there, the easier it is for beginners to get started. And the [rdo-list mailing list](https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/rdo-list) is the other place where you can get questions answered, or answer those of others. Please join us.

## Recent Events

Although things tend to be quieter this time of year, we have been at a few events in the past month.

RDO had a place at the Red Hat Open Source and Standards table at [SCALE](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/15x) last month in Los Angeles. This is always a fun event, with hundreds of local school kids turning out on Saturday to learn about open source, Linux, and Maker projects. We had the privilege of explaining to these curious beginners why companies participate in open source, what the cloud is, and how the OpenStack community works.

[OpenStack Days Poland](http://www.openstackday.pl/) was held March 22 in Warsaw. Community member Ana Krivokapic was there, and we expect to have a report from her in the coming days.

## Upcoming Events 

We are just a month out from [OpenStack Summit, Boston](https://www.openstack.org/summit/boston-2017) now, and the schedule is now posted. There's a ton of great content, including many sessions by RDO community members. We expect to have an RDO community gathering at Summit, but details are still up in the air. Be sure to follow us on Twitter - @RDOCommunity - so you'll be the first to know when we firm up the location and details.

Later this month we'll have the first Pike test day for the milestone one. That will be held on April 20th and 21st. We'll be testing TripleO and Packstack deployments, along with the upstream deployment documentation, so we could really use your help to get full coverage of our test matrix. Details about test days are at [https://www.rdoproject.org/testday/](https://www.rdoproject.org/testday/).

Next Sunday, April 16, in Pune, the Indian OpenStack User Group will be holding "[Pune, Let's OpenStack 2017](https://www.meetup.com/Indian-OpenStack-User-Group/events/238458999/)" This event will bring together the OpenStack community in the region, and will be useful whether you're a beginner just learning about OpenStack, or a seasoned cloud operator looking for a place to get deeper advice from your peers. 

Other RDO events, including the many OpenStack meetups around the world, are always listed on the [RDO events page](http://rdoproject.org/events). If you have an RDO-related event, please feel free to add it by submitting a pull request [on Github](https://github.com/OSAS/rh-events/blob/master/2016/RDO-Meetups.yml).

## Interviews from PTG

In late February, the OpenStack PTG (Project Teams Gathering) was held in Atlanta, and Rich conducted intervews with 23 engineers that work on OpenStack and the RDO project. Over the last month, these interviews have been posted to YouTube, and you can watch them here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOuHvpVx7kYksG0NFaCaQsSkrUlj3Oq4S  The entire playlist runs about 2 1/2 hours, and will give you a broad view of what's new in the Ocata release of OpenStack across many of the subprojects. It will also give you some deep information about specific changes in some of these projects.

We are also reposting these, with transcripts, on the RDO blog, and you can see the first few of those here:

Look for the rest in the coming weeks.

## Community meetings 

Every Wednesday at 15:00 UTC, we have the weekly RDO community meeting on the #RDO channel on Freenode IRC. The agenda for this meeting is posted each week in a [public etherpad](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/RDO-Meeting) and the minutes from the meeting are posted [on the RDO website](https://www.rdoproject.org/community/community-meeting/). If there's something you'd like to see happen in RDO - a package that is missing, a tool that you'd like to see included, or a change in how things are governed - this is the best time and place to help make that happen.
