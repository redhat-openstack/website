## OpenStack Summit!

We are one month away from OpenStack Summit, and RDO will be
there!

[OpenStack Summit](http://openstack.org/summit)
will be held in Sydney, Australia, November 6-8,
overlooking the beautiful Sydney Harbor. We would love to see you. We'll
have ducks, again, like every year.
[http://rdoproject.org/blog/2015/10/ducks/](http://rdoproject.org/blog/2015/10/ducks/)

And, we'll be having an informal gathering on Tuesday evening, starting
at 6pm, at the [PumpHouse](http://pumphousesydney.com.au/). Watch the
rdo-list mailing list for signup details, coming real soon, as soon as
details are finalized.

OpenStack Summit is the best place and time in the world to find out
everything about OpenStack, and to meet other OpenStack enthusiasts.
And, of course, it's the only place in the world where you can get these
exclusive RDO ducks.

If you're interested in helping out at the RDO booth at Summit, please
[sign up for a
time](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/rdo-sydney-summit-booth). Rich
will be there the whole time, but we always need extra people to answer
questions, explain what RDO is, and just be friendly.

## CentOS Dojo at CERN!

Coming up in just over a week, OpenStack and CentOS enthusiasts will be
gathering in Meyrin, Switzerland, at the amazing CERN facility, for a
CentOS Dojo. This will be Friady, October 20th, and you can find out
more details at [cern.ch/centos](http://cern.ch/centos).

If you're
planning to come, you **must** register, in order to be admitted to the
facility. They're very serious about security, as you might imagine.

Presentations will cover CentOS CI, how the various SIGs work, and also
include an overview of how CERN uses CentOS and OpenStack in their
research into the secrets of the universe. We would love to see you
there.

## OpenStack PTG

Last month, the OpenStack PTG was held in Denver, Colorado. The PTG -
the Project Teams Gathering - is the meeting where the next version of
OpenStack is planned out.

While there, Rich had the opportunity to interview a number of the
project teams, and several PTLs - Project Technical Leads - about what
was accomplished in Pike, and what's coming in Queens.

These interviews are now all published on the [RDO YouTube
channel](http://youtube.com/RDOCommunity) for your viewing pleasure.

If you'd like to do an interview for the RDO YouTube channel, about your
work in OpenStack, please just [let Rich know](mailto:rbowen@redhat.com)
and we can set up a time.

## Other events

If you're in France or Germany (or anywhere nearby) you should go to
[OpenStack Days France](http://www.openstackdayfrance.fr/) (November
21st) and [OpenStack Days Germany](https://www.openstack-dach.org/)
(December 8th and 9th). Tickets are still available, and the schedules
look great. If you'd like to represent RDO at either of these events,
please get in touch with Rich for information on how we can support you.

Other RDO events, including the many OpenStack meetups around the
world, are always listed on the [RDO events page](http://rdoproject.org/events).
If you have an RDO-related event, please feel free to add it by submitting a pull
request [on Github](https://github.com/OSAS/rh-events/blob/master/2016/RDO-Meetups.yml).

## OpenStack SIG in Fedora

This week, Haïkel
[announced](https://www.redhat.com/archives/rdo-list/2017-October/msg00026.html)
a new OpenStack SIG within the Fedora ecosystem. This will be focused on
packaging, testing, and maintaining OpenStack clients within Fedora, to
ensure that Fedora users have access to the latest tools to manage their
OpenStack clouds.

If you are interested in participating in this process, discussion and
work will be happening primarily on the [RDO mailing
list](https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/rdo-list).

## Community meetings

Every Wednesday at 15:00 UTC, we have the weekly RDO community meeting
on the #RDO channel on Freenode IRC. The agenda for this meeting is
posted each week in a [public
etherpad](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/RDO-Meeting) and the minutes
from the meeting are posted [on the RDO
website](https://www.rdoproject.org/community/community-meeting/). If
there's something you'd like to see happen in RDO - a package that is
missing, a tool that you'd like to see included, or a change in how
things are governed - this is the best time and place to help make that
happen.
