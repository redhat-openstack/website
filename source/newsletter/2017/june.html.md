Thanks for being part of the RDO community!

Thanks to those that were paying attention, and missed the May
newsletter. I was traveling for 3 weeks in May, and the newsletter
slipped through the cracks.

As always I love hearing your feedback about the newsletter, as well as
your input into what content we need to add to it. Thanks!

## Contributor Survey

A few months ago, we conducted a survey of RDO developers to discover
what we can do better, and what we should do differently, to improve the
developer experience around RDO. Hopefully this, in turn, will also
improve the user experience.

Last week we published the results of that survey. With 21 RDO
developers responding, we got a pretty consistent message that the best
thing we can do is improve the documentation, so that it's less of a
barrier to new contributors. You can read the survey results on the [RDO
blog](https://www.rdoproject.org/blog/2017/05/rdo-contributor-survey/)
and you can see the detailed feedback on the [RDO mailing
list](https://www.redhat.com/archives/rdo-list/2017-May/msg00051.html)

To this end, we'll be running an RDO Documentation Sprint Day in the coming
weeks. See the 'Upcoming Events' section below for more details.

See also the [RDO User Survey
results](https://www.rdoproject.org/blog/2016/11/how-are-you-using-rdo/)
from last last year.

## Recent Events

In May, there were two big events for RDO.

The first week of May we had a booth at Red Hat Summit in Boston, where
we showcased the RDO minicluster, running RDO Newton on 4 Intel NUC
machines. (There will be a longer writeup of this cluster on the [RDO
blog](http://rdoproject.org/blog/) next week!)  We also shared space
with the ManageIQ project, who connected their NUC cluster to ours, and
managed our RDO cloud from their control panel. We also had a lot of
great conversations with users of RDO.

The following week, we were back in Boston for OpenStack Summit, this
time at the Hynes convention center. RDO shared space with Red Hat at
the headline sponsor booth, where we had many more great conversations
with RDO users, and once again demo'ed our minicluster. And, of course,
as at every OpenStack Summit, we had
[ducks](https://www.rdoproject.org/blog/2015/10/ducks/).

On Wednesday evening, we had a gathering of RDO users and developers,
with about 60 in attendance, to celebrate the community, and thank you
for being part of the RDO effort. Thanks to all who attended. (You can
see some photos of the event on
[Google+](https://plus.google.com/+RichBowen/posts/jTqcvYw4maS)

We appreciate each of you who visited us at our booth. We would love to
hear more from you. Join us on the [RDO-list mailing
list](https://www.rdoproject.org/community/mailing-lists/), or drop in
on the #RDO channel on the Freenode IRC network.

## Upcoming Events

There's lots of opportunities to connect with the RDO community in
person, in the coming weeks and months. We'd love to hear your RDO
stories, and find out what we can do better. Here's some of the places
where members of the RDO community will be out in force.

This week, there's two OpenStack Days events.

First, there's [OpenStack Israel](http://www.openstack-israel.org/), in
Tel Aviv, on June 5. As always, this is a [full day of OpenStack
content](http://www.openstack-israel.org/agenda) from leading experts in
the field. But it's also a great opportunity to connect with the
community, share stories with colleagues, and learn about best practices
in the real world.

Later this week, on June 7 [OpenStack Days Budapest](http://openstackceeday.com/) will be held at the Nokia Skypark Office. There will be
[three tracks](http://openstackceeday.com/schedule) of OpenStack
Content, and another opportunity to mingle with the community.

And, towards the end of the month - on June 27th and 28th,
[Deutche OpenStack Tage](https://openstack-tage.de/) will be held in
MÃ¼nchen, at the Leonardo Royal, with another [two days of great
OpenStack content](https://openstack-tage.de/programm/), and another
opportunity to rub shoulders with the people who make OpenStack happen.

Looking a little further out, please mark your calendars for the two
upcoming events:

On September 5th, we have tentatively scheduled a meetup at LOPSA
(League of Professional System Administrators) in Oak Ridge, Tennesee,
in conjunction with the data scientists at Oak Ridge National
Laboratories. We'll have more details in the coming weeks, but expect
lots of OpenStack content, and lots of cool use cases from ORNL, where
they use OpenStack as part of their nuclear research program.

On October 20th, the CentOS community will be holding a Dojo (that's
what they call their one-day events) at CERN. This event will focus on
HPC (High Performance Computing) and OpenStack on CentOS. As you may
know, CERN has one of the largest OpenStack clouds in the world, running
RDO on CentOS, and so we'll have access to some of the leading experts
in running OpenStack at scale. This is the Friday immediately before the
Open Source Summit in Prague, and so it's an opportunity to combine two
trips into one, and learn twice as much. Details to come within the next
month.

And, every week, there are OpenStack meetups, around the world. These
are the best place to connect with your local community, and learn the
skills you need to be an effective cloud operator. You can get an update
of upcoming OpenStack meetups every week on the [rdo-list mailing
list](http://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/rdo-list), or on the [RDO
events page](http://rdoproject.org/events/).

## Community meetings

Every Wednesday at 15:00 UTC, we have the weekly RDO community meeting on the #RDO channel on Freenode IRC. The agenda for this meeting is posted each week in a [public etherpad](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/RDO-Meeting) and the minutes from the meeting are posted [on the RDO website](https://www.rdoproject.org/community/community-meeting/).

If there's something you'd like to see happen in RDO - a package that is missing, a tool that you'd like to see included, or a change in how things are governed - this is the best time and place to help make that happen.
