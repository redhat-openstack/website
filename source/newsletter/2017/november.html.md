## Mailing list changes

You may notice that this email came with a different address this time.
There have been some changes to our mailing list setup that you will
want to know about.

This list - the RDO Community Newsletter - is now delivered to the
address newsletter@lists.rdoproject.org rather than the old
rdo-newsletter@redhat.com

The main rdo-list mailing list has been split into two lists -
dev@lists.rdoproject.org and users@lists.rdoproject.org - primarily in
order to make the users mailing list more welcoming to operators and
users of RDO, while the more technical development-centric discussion
will take place on the dev mailing list.

You don't need to do anything, if you want to keep receiving this
newsletter.

However, if you wish to post to either the dev list or the users list,
you will, of course, have to send to the new addresses.

You can see the full listing, and list archives, at
[lists.rdoproject.org](http://lists.rdoproject.org) and manage your
preferences there, too. You should have received a reminder email on
November 1st with information about logging into that site to manage
your preferences.

## OpenStack Summit

Even as I write this, many members of the OpenStack community are
already traveling to Sydney, Australia, for [OpenStack
Summit](http://openstack.org/summit). This edition of the conference
will be held November 6th through 8th at the Sydney Convention and
Exhibition Centre on Darling Harbour.

RDO will have a booth, as part of Red Hat's event presence. We'll have
[ducks](https://www.rdoproject.org/blog/2015/10/ducks/), stickers, and the answers to all of your questions.
So please drop by!

We'll also be gathering at The Pumphouse on Tuesday evening to
celebrate another great release. You can sign up on
[Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/rdo-social-at-the-pumphouse-tickets-38766394329)
to attend. It's free, but we need registrations so we know how many to
expect.

## Test Day

With the Queens milestone 1 out, we're planning another test day,
tentatively scheduled for November 15th, once people are back from
OpenStack Summit. Watch the [test
day](http://rdoproject.org/testday/queens/milestone1/) page for updated
details as we get closer to that date.

Test days are a way to ensure that, beyond the automated testing, new
releases work for the people that will be using them, in the scenarios
where they will use them. While automated testing catches almost
everything, there are sometimes individual differences in your
particular environment which may tickle some bug, or suggest a feature
that needs to be different.

So your participation in test day is a great service to the community,
and also gives you advance notice of what will be coming in the next
release.

Hope to see you there, in the #RDO IRC channel, on Freenode, as we test
this next release.

## Community meetings

Every Wednesday at 15:00 UTC, we have the weekly RDO community meeting
on the #RDO channel on Freenode IRC. The agenda for this meeting is
posted each week in a [public
etherpad](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/RDO-Meeting) and the minutes
from the meeting are posted [on the RDO
website](https://www.rdoproject.org/community/community-meeting/). If
there's something you'd like to see happen in RDO - a package that is
missing, a tool that you'd like to see included, or a change in how
things are governed - this is the best time and place to help make that
happen.
