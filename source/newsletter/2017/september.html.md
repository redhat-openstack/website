## RDO Pike Released!

The RDO community is pleased to announce the general availability of the RDO build for OpenStack Pike for RPM-based distributions, CentOS Linux 7 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

Pike is the 16th release from the
[OpenStack project](http://openstack.org), which is the work
of more than 2300 contributors from around the world
([source](http://stackalytics.com/)). Pike released upstream on [August
30th](https://releases.openstack.org/pike/index.html), after which RDO
packages had to be created and tested through CI. These packages were
then made available on September 1st.

The release is described in greater detail in the [RDO
blog](https://www.rdoproject.org/blog/2017/09/rdo-pike-released/), and
we encourage you to follow our blog for future updates.

## OpenStack PTG

Next week, the OpenStack Foundation will hold the second edition of the
[OpenStack PTG](http://openstack.org/ptg), in Denver, Colorado. At this
event, project teams discuss what will go into the Queens release. Teams
also meet together to discuss how those projects interact, and which
team will implement which feathre.

These meetings run from September 11th through September 15th, after
which we'll start to hear from the various project teams about what
to expect in Queens.

Rich Bowen will be at the PTG to conduct video interviews, as he did in
Atlanta earlier this year. (You can see the videos from last time [on
YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kT-Sv3rkTw&list=PLOuHvpVx7kYksG0NFaCaQsSkrUlj3Oq4S).)
If you're planning to be there, please consider [signing
up](http://tm3.org/ptg-interviews) to talk about what you did during the
Pike cycle, or how you are using OpenStack.

Other RDO events, including the many OpenStack meetups around the
world, are always listed on the [RDO events page](http://rdoproject.org/events).
If you have an RDO-related event, please feel free to add it by submitting a pull
request [on Github](https://github.com/OSAS/rh-events/blob/master/2016/RDO-Meetups.yml).

## Other Events ...

### CentOS Dojo at CERN

RDO will be participating in a CentOS Dojo, or community gathering, at
CERN, in Meyrin, Switzerland, on October 20th. You can find out more
about the event, and sign up, at [the event
website](https://indico.cern.ch/event/649159/overview).

At this meetup, we'll have a report on what has been happening in RDO
over the last few months. And we'll hear a report from CERN about how
they are using RDO in their data center as part of the research that
happens at CERN.

### Open Source Summit

The Open Source Summit (formerly known as LinuxCon) will be held [in Los
Angeles next
week](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/open-source-summit-north-america)
and [in
Prague](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/open-source-summit-europe)
in October. RDO will have a presence at both events, in the Red Hat
booth. Drop by for RDO stickers, OpenStack cheatcheet bookmarks, and RDO
advice.

### OpenStack Days

The following OpenStack days are coming up, and each of them will have
RDO enthusiasts in attendance:

* [Sep 14, 2017 - OpenStack Days Benelux, Bussum, NL](http://www.openstack.nl/en/events/)

If you're speaking at any of these events, please get in touch with me,
so that I can help promote your presence there.

### Meetups

Finally, we encourage you to attend your local OpenStack meetup. There's
hundreds of them, all over the world, every day. We post a list of
upcoming meetups to the RDO mailing list each Monday, so that you can
mark your calendar. Or you can search
[meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/) for events near you.


## Community meetings

Every Wednesday at 15:00 UTC, we have the weekly RDO community meeting
on the #RDO channel on Freenode IRC. The agenda for this meeting is
posted each week in a [public
etherpad](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/RDO-Meeting) and the minutes
from the meeting are posted [on the RDO
website](https://www.rdoproject.org/community/community-meeting/). If
there's something you'd like to see happen in RDO - a package that is
missing, a tool that you'd like to see included, or a change in how
things are governed - this is the best time and place to help make that
happen.
