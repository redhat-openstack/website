### Welcome to RDO Docs Days
The next RDO Docs Days will be 17-21 February - just after Ussuri milestone 2! We periodically run Docs Days - encouraging people to improve the documentation and the website by spending an hour or two looking for errors, outdated information, or anything else that could be better.

Goals for a docs day include:
* Knock out as many of the [open issues](https://github.com/redhat-openstack/website/issues) as possible.
* Identify docs that are outdated, and/or refer to end-of-lifed releases.
* Consolidate duplicate docs.
* Improve the [test day instructions](https://www.rdoproject.org/testday/tests/), so that people don't have to be experts to participate.

Meanwhile, you can always work on the [open issues](https://github.com/redhat-openstack/website/issues).

### Have You Heard of OpenStack Commons?
OpenShift Commons builds connections and collaboration across OpenShift communities, projects and stakeholders. In doing so, they enable the success of customers, users, partners, and contributors as they deepen knowledge and experiences together.

These goals go beyond code contributions. Commons is a place for companies using OpenShift to accelerate its success and adoption. Commons acts as resources for everyone, sharing best practices and providing a forum for peer-to-peer communication. 

We’d like to do the same for OpenStack! 

We started this process with the relaunch of the [OpenShift on OpenStack Special Interest Group](https://commons.openshift.org/sig/OpenshiftOpenstack.html) at Red Hat Summit 2019 in order to discuss, develop and disseminate best practices for deploying and managing OpenShift on OpenStack. 

This year, on 26 April 2020, just before Red Hat Summit 2020, for the first time, there will be an OpenStack track at [OpenShift Commons](https://commons.openshift.org/). If you’re interested in attending and / or participating, please reach out to Rain Leander, leanderthal on Freenode irc, or directly via rain at redhat dot com.

And our ultimate goal in the near future is to launch **OpenStack Commons**, to bring users, partners, customers, and contributors together to collaborate and work on OpenStack.

### Community Meetings
Every Tuesday at 13:30 UTC, we have a weekly **TripleO CI community meeting** on [https://meet.google.com/bqx-xwht-wky](https://meet.google.com/bqx-xwht-wky) with the agenda on [https://hackmd.io/IhMCTNMBSF6xtqiEd9Z0Kw](https://hackmd.io/IhMCTNMBSF6xtqiEd9Z0Kw). The TripleO CI meeting focuses on a group of people focusing on Continuous Integration tooling and system who would like to provide a comprehensive testing framework that is easily reproducible for TripleO contributors. This framework should also be consumable by other CI systems (OPNFV, RDO, vendor CI, etc.), so that TripleO can be tested the same way everywhere. This is NOT a place for TripleO usage questions, rather, check out the next meeting listed just below.

Every Tuesday at 14:00 UTC, immediately following the TripleO CI meeting is the weekly **TripleO Community meeting** on the #TripleO channel on Freenode IRC. The agenda for this meeting is posted each week in a [public etherpad](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/tripleo-meeting-items). This is for addressing anything to do with TripleO, including usage, feature requests, and bug reports.

Every Wednesday at 14:00 UTC, we have a weekly **RDO community meeting** on the #RDO channel on Freenode IRC. The agenda for this meeting is posted each week in a [public etherpad](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/RDO-Meeting) and the minutes from the meeting are posted [on the RDO website](https://www.rdoproject.org/community/community-meeting/). If there's something you'd like to see happen in RDO - a package that is missing, a tool that you'd like to see included, or a change in how things are governed - this is the best time and place to help make that happen.

Every Thursday at 15:00 UTC, there is a weekly **CentOS Cloud SIG meeting** on the #centos-devel channel on Freenode IRC. The agenda for this meeting is posted each week in a [public etherpad](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/centos-cloud-sig) and the minutes from the meeting are posted [on the RDO website](https://www.rdoproject.org/contribute/cloud-sig-meeting/). This meeting makes sense for people that are involved in packaging OpenStack for CentOS and for people that are packaging OTHER cloud infra things (OpenNebula, CloudStack, Euca, etc) for CentOS. “Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.” - Helen Keller

### Upcoming OSF Event: OpenDev + PTG, June 8-11 in Vancouver
Join us this June in Vancouver for OpenDev + PTG, and [grab your early bird tickets now](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/opendev-ptg-vancouver-2020-tickets-88923270897)! 

OpenDev + PTG is a new collaborative event organized by the OpenStack Foundation gathering developers, system architects, and operators to address common open source infrastructure challenges.

June 8-11, 2020
Vancouver Convention Centre - East Building

OpenDev will include discussion oriented sessions around a particular topic to explore a problem within a topic area, share common architectures, and collaborate around potential solutions. This OpenDev will focus specifically on the following Tracks, spanning open source projects, including Airship, Ansible, Ceph, Kata Containers, Kubernetes, OpenStack, StarlingX, and Zuul:

* Hardware Automation
* Large-scale Usage of Open Source Infrastructure Software
* Containers in Production 
* Key Challenges for Open Source in 2020 

The conversations will continue into the afternoon with the [Project Teams Gathering (PTG)](https://www.openstack.org/ptg). This is when the morning’s practices will be explored by project teams, SIGs and other workgroups who will have dedicated space to get work done in a productive setting, maximizing the ability of contributors to work through their project objectives in an environment that is focused towards work and productivity.

### Help Shape the Track Content for OpenDev + PTG
OpenStack Foundation needs your help shaping this event! Our vision is for the content to be programmed by you-- the community. OSF is looking to kick things off by selecting members for OpenDev Programming Committees for each Track. That Program Committee will then select Moderators who will lead interactive discussions on a particular topic within the track. Below you'll have the opportunity to nominate yourself for a position on the Programming Committee, as a Moderator, or both, as well as suggesting specific Topics within each Track. PTG programming will kick off in the coming weeks.

If you’re interested in volunteering as an OpenDev Programming Committee member, discussion Moderator, or would like to suggest topics for moderated discussions within a particular Track, please read the details below, and then [fill out this form](https://openstackfoundation.formstack.com/forms/opendev_vancouver2020_volunteer). 

We’re looking for subject matter experts on the following OpenDev Tracks:
* Hardware Automation (accelerators, provisioning hardware, networking)
* Large-scale Usage of Open Source Infrastructure Software (scale pain points, multi-location, CI/CD)
* Containers in Production (isolation, virtualization, telecom containers)
* Key Challenges for Open Source in 2020 (beyond licensing, public clouds, ethics)

**OpenDev Programming Committee** members will: 
* Work with other Committee members, which will include OSF representatives, to curate OpenDev content based on subject expertise, community input, and relevance to open source infrastructure
* Promote the individual Tracks within your networks
* Review community input and suggestions for Track discussions
* Solicit moderators from your network if you know someone who is a subject matter expert
* Ensure diversity of speakers and companies represented in your Track
* Focus topics around on real-world user stories and technical, in-the-trenches experiences
* Receive a complimentary pass to the event!

Programming Committee members need to be available during the following dates/time commitments:
* 8 - 10 hours from February - May for bi-weekly calls with your Track's Programming Committee (plus a couple of OSF representatives to facilitate the call)
* OpenDev, June 8 - 10, 2020 (not required, but preferred)

Programming Committees will be comprised of a few people per Track who will work to select a handful of topics and moderators for each Track. The exact topic counts will be determined before Committees begin deciding.

**OpenDev Discussion Moderators** will 
* Be appointed by the Programming Committees
* Facilitate discussions within a particular Track
* Have adequate knowledge and experience to lead and moderate discussion around certain topics during the event
* Work with Programming Committee to decide focal point of discussion
Moderators need to be available to attend OpenDev, June 8 - 10, 2020, and will receive a complimentary pass. 
Programming Committee nominations are open until **February 11**. Deadlines to volunteer to be a moderator and suggest topics will be in late February.

Nominate yourself or suggest discussion topics here:  [https://openstackfoundation.formstack.com/](https://openstackfoundation.formstack.com/forms/opendev_vancouver2020_volunteer).

### Announcing OpenStack Victoria!
The polling results are in, and the legal vetting process has now completed. We now have an official name for the "V" release.

The full results of the poll can be found at [https://civs.cs.cornell.edu/](https://civs.cs.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/results.pl?num_winners=1&id=E_13ccd49b66cfd1b4&rkey=4e184724fa32eed6&algorithm=minimax)

While Victoria and Vancouver were technically a tie, based on the Minimax rankingi, it puts Victoria slightly ahead of Vancouver based on the votes. In addition to that, we chose to have the TC do a tie breaker vote which confirmed Victoria as the winner.

Victoria is the capital city of British Columbia [https://en.wikipedia.org/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria,_British_Columbia)

Thank you all for participating in the release naming!

### Collecting Scaling Stories
As part of its goal of further pushing back scaling limits within a given cluster, the Large Scale SIG would like to collect scaling stories from OpenStack users.

There is a size / load limit for single clusters past which things in OpenStack start to break, and we need to start using multiple clusters or cells to scale out. The SIG is interested in hearing:

* what broke first for you, is it RabbitMQ or something else
* what were the first symptoms
* at what size/load did it start to break

This will be a great help to document expected limits, and identify where improvements should be focused.

You can contribute your experience by [adding to the following etherpad](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/scaling-stories)

Thanks in advance for your help!

### DevConf.CZ Brno Czech Republic 24-26 January 2020
[DevConf.CZ](devconf.info/cz/) 2020 is the 12th annual, free, Red Hat sponsored community conference for developers, admins, DevOps engineers, testers, documentation writers and other contributors to open source technologies. The conference includes topics on Linux, Middleware, Virtualization, Storage, Cloud and mobile. At DevConf.CZ, FLOSS communities sync, share, and hack on upstream projects together in the beautiful city of Brno, Czech Republic.

There were several RDO activities at DevConf.CZ including:
* [RDO Project Birds of a Feather](https://devconfcz2020a.sched.com/event/YS7F/rdo-project-bof) Hosted by Rain leander. An informal meet-up for those interested in talking about RDO TripleO OpenStack PackStack and all things Cloud. Members of the RDO Community answered questions about contributing, collaborating,getting started with, and using OpenStack. 
* [Edge Computing using OpenStack Cloud for IOT](https://devconfcz2020a.sched.com/event/YOoi/edge-computing-using-openstack-cloud-for-iot) co-presented by [Rohit Londhe](https://devconfcz2020a.sched.com/speaker/rlondhe) and [Nilesh Chandekar](https://devconfcz2020a.sched.com/speaker/nilesh_chandekar.1zqdvw56). One of the trending technology when it comes to implementation of 5G and IoT applications is Edge computing. Using OpenStack Cloud we will showcase the implementation of Edge Nodes which will host end-user applications. These edge nodes will directly reside in end-user premises or near-by DC, thus reducing the latency and increasing the processing and computational power.
* The RDO Community had a booth next to ManageIQ and Ceph which gave away vintage and modern RDO, OpenStack, and TripleO stickers and had a full collection of RDO ducks from the past three years of Summits to drool over. Special shout out to community members Vikas Mulaje, Tony Breeds, Jirka Stransky, Rain Leander, and Iury Ferreira for volunteering to hang out at the booth and answer questions. #ThankYOU

### FOSDEM Brussels Belgium 01-02 February 2020
[FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2020/) is a free event for software developers to meet, share ideas and collaborate. Every year, thousands of developers of free and open source software from all over the world gather at the event in Brussels. No registration necessary.

While the OpenStack Foundation has a stand presence at FOSDEM, the individual distributions, like RDO, do not, but several RDO community members were in attendance **and** there were several RDO stickers and Ussuri ducks floating around. Some of our favourite developer rooms, tracks, and talks included:

* [Virtualization and IaaS devroom](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/track/virtualization_and_iaas/) featured [vai io uring in QEMU: high-performance disk I/O for Linux](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/vai_io_uring_in_qemu/) by [Julia Suvorova](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/speaker/julia_suvorova/) and [Baremetal at the Edge Managing bare metal machines where PXE would fail](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/vai_baremetal_at_the_edge/) by [Ilya Etingof](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/speaker/ilya_etingof/)
* [Containers devroom](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/track/containers/) included [Below Kubernetes: Demystifying container runtimes](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/containers_k8s_runtimes/) by [Thierry Carrez](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/speaker/thierry_carrez/) and [Podman - The Powerful Container Multi-Tool An use case driven hands-on to the container management tool Podman](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/containers_podman/) by [Sascha Grunert](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/speaker/sascha_grunert/)
* [Freedom track](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/track/freedom/) had the insightful [Why Open Infrastructure Matters](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/open_infrastructure/) talk by [Thierry Carrez](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/speaker/thierry_carrez/) 

### Call For Papers
There are a handful of relevant conferences with open CFPs. Need help figuring out a good topic or finalizing your abstract? Feel free to reach out in the #RDO channel on IRC.

* **stackconf Berlin Germany 17-18 June 2020** With the changes in modern IT the profile of the former Open Source Data Center Conference has more and more shifted from a mainly on-site approach to open source infrastructure solutions to a broader spectrum of continuous integration, container, hybrid and cloud solutions. Thoughts, workflows and thus our conference topics have progressively extended to more dynamic and agile environments, from only data center to a whole stack. Bridging the gap between development, testing and operations is one of the fundamental paradigms in modern IT. stackconf covers this concept from multiple perspectives. Trendsetting concepts, state-of-the-art technical expertise, top-level discussions and new perspectives in dealing with complex IT infrastructures have shaped the event since 2009. How you run your applications and IT infrastructure in production has a big influence on designing and building your technology stack. At [stackconf](https://stackconf.eu/) you can learn how. Well-known international open source professionals present their ideas within a two-day lecture program. Expect exciting discussions, an intensive exchange of experiences, inspiring encounters and great networking opportunities within the multi-faceted field of stackconf participants! [CFP closes 15 February 2020 15:23 UTC](https://www.papercall.io/osdc2020)

* **CloudOps Tel Aviv Israel 22 April 2020** is organized by local members of the DevOps, IT and Cloud Infrastructure community to increase the flow and exchange of ideas and experiences. [CloudOps](https://cloudopsummit.com/) will feature workshops, presentations and ample opportunity to connect with your peers where you’ll learn about what challenges others in your community are facing and the best practices and hacks they are using to turn those challenges into opportunities. Whether you are running your company’s entire cloud deployment on your own, or are a part of a huge, global technology team, CloudOps is the event that will help you get the recognition and appreciation you deserve and need to take your career to the next level. [CFP closes 28 February 2020 14:17 UTC](https://www.papercall.io/cloudops)

* **HashiConf EU Amsterdam Netherlands 08 June 2020** is HashiCorp’s annual [community conference](https://hashiconf.com/eu/), a multi-day experience created so you can connect with other HashiCorp community members, core contributors, customers, partners, and HashiCorp employees. Attendees exchange ideas and technical knowledge, connect with like-minded people, and learn from other community members who use HashiCorp tools and products every day. [CFP closes 17 March 2020 11:08 UTC](https://www.papercall.io/hashiconf-eu)
