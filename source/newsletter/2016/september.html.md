## Newton milestone 3 test day

Please join us on Thursday and Friday of this week to test the RDO
packages of the Newton milestone 3 release. Milestone 3 released
upstream last week, and we've been packaging and running CI on that
since then. We think Newton is going to be the best release of OpenStack
yet, and we need your help to ensure that this is the case.

We'll be gathering on the #rdo channel on the Freenode IRC network, as
well as posting our findings to the rdo-list mailing list.

For more information about this test day, see the [test day web 
page](https://www.rdoproject.org/testday/newton/milestone3/).

And we're just a few weeks out from the [scheduled Newton
release](https://releases.openstack.org/newton/schedule.html), on the
week of October 3rd.


## OpenStack Summit coming soon

OpenStack Summit is just a few weeks away - October 25-29 in Barcelona,
Spain - and we would love to see you there. We'll be in the expo hall,
in booth D1, on the right, just inside the main entrance.

If there's something interesting that you've done with RDO that you'd
like to demo at our pod, or if you just want to help answer RDO
questions, please let me know - we'd love to have you as part of our
demo schedule.

We also expect to have a community meetup at the Summit, as we usually
do. Details are still being worked out. We'll notify the rdo-list
mailing list as soon we we have a time and place confirmed.

You can register for the summit at 
[openstack.org/summit](https://www.openstack.org/summit).


## Upcoming events

In addition to OpenStack Summit, RDO will have a presence at a number of
other upcoming events. Each week, upcoming meetups are posted to
rdo-list, and also to the [RDO events
calendar](https://www.rdoproject.org/events/).

In particular, you will want to mark your calendar for the following
events:

* [The Red Hat OpenStack 
  Platform](http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-Red-Hat-User-Group/events/233282275/),
  September 8th in Pittsburgh.

* [MAD for
  OpenStack](http://www.meetup.com/MAD-for-OpenStack/events/233790123/),
  Madrid. September 14th.

* [PyCon India](https://in.pycon.org/2016/), September 24th and 25th in
  New Delhi.

* [LinuxDays Prague](https://www.linuxdays.cz/2016/), October 8th and
  9th.


## Contributing to the documentation

With the Newton release just around the corner, it's a good time to
refresh the website and the documentation. If you'd like to help with
this effort, here's what you need to get started.

Clone the Git repository at 
[https://github.com/redhat-openstack/website](https://github.com/redhat-openstack/website)
and follow the instructions in the README to get a local version of the
website running.

Look through the site, and identify documents that are outdated,
incorrect, or anything that you feel is missing. You can either correct
these yourself, and send pull requests, or open tickets at
[https://github.com/redhat-openstack/website/issues](https://github.com/redhat-openstack/website/issues).

Where we particularly need help is identifying documents that need to be
written. To this end, we need the help of beginners, to go through the
website, and see what information you need, which isn't readily
available.


## Community meeting


Ever  Wednesday at 15:00 UTC, we have the weekly RDO community meeting
on the #RDO channel on Freenode IRC. And at 15:00 UTC Thursdays, we
have the CentOS Cloud SIG Meeting on #centos-devel.

The agendas, and minutes, from these meetings, may be found in the
[rdo-list mail archives](https://www.redhat.com/archives/rdo-list/)
each week. The meeting typically covers everything from project status,
to upcoming event participation, to discussion of technical decisions.
Major decisions are always taken back to the mailing list for
consideration by the wider community.
