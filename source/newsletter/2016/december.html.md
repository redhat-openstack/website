## RDO Status

With the Newton release behind us, we're working on the Ocata release
now, with Milestone 1 already released. On December 1 and 2, we held the
[first Ocata test
day](https://www.rdoproject.org/testday/ocata/milestone1/), and have
just [two more test days planned](https://www.rdoproject.org/testday/),
since Ocata is a very short cycle.

You can track daily status of RDO on the [RDO
dashboard](https://dashboards.rdoproject.org/rdo-dev).

## Upcoming Events

The first month after OpenStack Summit always tends to be a little slow,
but things are picking up again. There's several events in the coming
weeks that you should be aware of.

### OpenStack Days Mountain West

This week in Salt Lake City, another 'OpenStack Days' event will be
held - OpenStack Days Mountain West. The event is two full days of
OpenStack content, presented in a single track so that you don't miss
anything. Among other great content, TripleO Evangelist Rain Leander
will be participating in the ['Future of OpenStack'
panel](http://sched.co/8WnZ), and OpenStack Architect Ken Savich will
be talking about[PCI Passthrough with Red Hat OpenStack
Platform](http://sched.co/8ArY).

You can still register for the event at
[OpenStackDaysMW.com](http://www.openstackdaysmw.com/).

### DevConf

RDO will have a table at the upcoming [DevConf.cz](https://devconf.cz/)
event in Brno, Czech Republic. DevConf will be held January 27 - 29,
2017 at the Faculty of Information Technology, and features talks on a
wide variety of topics encompasing development, administration, and user
issues around Linux. The schedule of talks will be posted in the coming
days.

### FOSDEM and the CentOS Dojo

[FOSDEM](http://fosdem.org) will be held in Brussels, Belgium, at
the ULB Solbosch Campus. It's the largest gathering of free/open
source software enthusiasts in the world, and has been going for more
than 15 years. FOSDEM will be held February 4th and 5th.

As usual, RDO will be sharing table space with CentOS, Gluster, Ceph,
Fedora, Foreman, and other projects.

We will also be participating in the CentOS Dojo on the Friday before
FOSDEM - February 3rd - at the [IBM Client
Center](http://www.ibm.com/ibm/clientcenter/brussels/) out by the United
Nations building. The CentOS Dojo is primarily about how people use
CentOS to get stuff done, with lots of discussion and hands-on
demonstrations. The schedule is still being worked on, but we anticipate
some talks about how RDO uses the CentOS infrastructure in our testing
and packaging workflow.

Watch the @rdocommunity twitter feed for more information as soon as we
have it.

### PTG

As you may know, the developer summit portion of OpenStack Summit has
been split off into a separate event, which will be held one 3 months
before the date of each OpenStack Summit. These will be called the PTG -
the Projet Team Gathering.

The first PTG will be held in [Atlanta, February 20-24,
2017](http://www.openstack.org/ptg) and will be attended by a large
number of the engineers that work on the various parts of OpenStack.

If you are actively involved in OpenStack development, you are
encouraged to attend this event. More detailed information on who should
attend, and how to register, is available on the [PTG
website](http://www.openstack.org/ptg).

### Meetups

Other RDO events, including the many OpenStack meetups around the
world, are always listed on the
[RDO events page](http://rdoproject.org/events).

## Blog Posts

There's been some great blog posts in the last month. Here's a sampling:

**Upstream Contribution – Give Up or Double Down?** by assafmuller

> Ever since I’ve been involved with OpenStack people have been complaining that upstream is hard. The number one complaint is that it takes forever to get your patches merged. I thought I’d take a look at some data and attempt to visualize it. I wrote some code that accepts an OpenStack project and a list of contributors and spits out a bunch of graphs. For example:

**Ocata OpenStack summit 2016 - Barcelona** by Carlos Camacho

> A few weeks ago I had the opportunity to attend to the Barcelona  OpenStack summit ‘Ocata design session’ and this post is related  to collect some overall information about it. In order to achieve this,   I’m crawling into my paper notes to highlight the aspects IMHO are relevant.

what the RDO community is blogging about.

## Community meetings

Every Wednesday at 15:00 UTC, we have the weekly RDO community meeting
on the #RDO channel on Freenode IRC. The agenda for this meeting is
posted each week in a [public
etherpad](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/RDO-Meeting) and the minutes
from the meeting are posted [on the RDO
website](https://www.rdoproject.org/community/community-meeting/). If
there's something you'd like to see happen in RDO - a package that is
missing, a tool that you'd like to see included, or a change in how
things are governed - this is the best time and place to help make that
happen.
