## Upcoming Events

There's several events on the horizon that you should be aware of.

### LinuxCon Berlin

This week, [LinuxCon
Europe](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/linuxcon-europe)
will be held in Berlin, Germany, and RDO will be there. Drop by the Red
Hat booth for RDO stickers, and to find out more about RDO and
OpenStack. Christian Schwede will be speaking about [OpenStack
Swift](http://sched.co/7o9Z), and will be available at the booth
afterwards to answer your questions. If you can't make it to Berlin, you
can watch the [live video
feed](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/linuxcon-europe/program/live-video-stream)
of the keynotes.

### OpenStack Summit and the RDO Community Meetup

In just a few weeks, many of us will be in Barcelona for the [OpenStack
Summit](https://www.openstack.org/summit). The summit, which will be
held on October 25th through 28th, is
where we will celebrate the Newton release, and begin planning for the
Ocata release.

While there, we'll be having the RDO community meetup, in conjunction
with the Ceph community. We'll be gathering at the [Barcelona
Princess](http://en.hotelbarcelonaprincess.com/restaurants/the-gym-bar/)
on Tuesday evening, the 25th, from 5pm to 8pm, for presentations about
RDO and Ceph, as well as light refreshments and drinks. If you have
something you'd like to present on for 5-10 minutes, please get in touch
with me as soon as possible.

We're also pleased to note that [over 40 of our colleagues in the RDO
project](http://redhatstackblog.redhat.com/2016/09/13/red-hat-confirms-over-40-accepted-sessions-at-openstack-summit-barcelona/)
have talks accepted at the Summit, on a wide variety of topics, many
directly related to their work on RDO.

And we'll be in the Red Hat booth in the main exhibit hall. Come get
your [RDO duck](https://www.rdoproject.org/blog/2015/10/ducks/).

## Blog Posts

The RDO community has numerous prolific bloggers who keep us updated on
the state of development in the OpenStack world. Here's some of the
great blog posts over the past month.

**Our Cloud in Liberty** by Tim Bell

> The upgrade to Liberty for the CERN cloud was completed at the end of August. Working with the upstream OpenStack, Puppet and RDO communities, this went pretty smoothly without any issues so there is no significant advice to report.

**Red Hat OpenStack Platform and Tesora Database-as-a-Service Platform: What’s New** by Rob Young, Principal Product Manager, Red Hat

**Integrating Red Hat Virtualization and Red Hat OpenStack Platform with Neutron Networking** by CaptainKVM

> As applications are designed, redesigned, or even simply thought about at a high level, we frequently think about technical barriers along side business needs.

**Complex data transformations with nested Heat intrinsic functions** by Steve Hardy

> Disclaimer, what follows is either pretty neat, or pure-evil depending your your viewpoint ;)  But it's based on a real use-case and it works, so I'm posting this to document the approach, why it's needed, and hopefully stimulate some discussion around optimizations leading to a improved/simplified implementation in the future.

**Red Hat OpenStack Platform 9 is here! So what’s new?** by Marcos Garcia
