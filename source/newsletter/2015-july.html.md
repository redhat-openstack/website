Thanks for being part of the RDO community!

1.  1.  Mailing List Update ##

Here's what's been going on in the RDO world since you last heard from me.

It's pretty common to want to integrate an OpenStack deployment with your existing external network. The documentation for how to accomplish this has been updated to reflect the current state of OpenStack. That document is at <https://www.rdoproject.org/Neutron_with_existing_external_network> and we welcome your feedback and corrections to that doc.

With the conversation happening in upstream OpenStack about the 'Big Tent' (See more about this idea at <http://tm3.org/big-tent>), it's worth discussing what this means to RDO. Specifically, what do we want to package in RDO? While the simple answer to this is "whatever the community makes happen", there are other things to consider. You can read this conversation in the archives at <https://www.redhat.com/archives/rdo-list/2015-June/msg00044.html> and <https://www.redhat.com/archives/rdo-list/2015-May/msg00284.html> Also, out of this conversation has come a document - still a work in progress - that documents what's in RDO right now. That's at <https://www.rdoproject.org/ProjectsInRDO>

The folks from Trystack gave an update on their plans for the near future. In particular, there was discussion of moving off of Facebook-based authenticaion to openstack.org-based authentication. You can read that conversation at <https://www.redhat.com/archives/rdo-list/2015-June/msg00045.html> As of this writing, x86.trystack.org is offline due to DC/network issues. You can check in #trystack, on the Freenode IRC network, for updates.

Boris Derzhavets did a nice writeup of switching to Spice console in RDO Kilo, which you read at <http://tm3.org/spice> There was further discussion of this on the list, which you can read at <https://www.redhat.com/archives/rdo-list/2015-June/msg00064.html>

The RDO-Manager team announced that work on HA support had been completed: <https://www.redhat.com/archives/rdo-list/2015-June/msg00070.html> You can see more about RDO-Manager at <https://www.rdoproject.org/RDO-Manager>

In response to conversations in the upstream about packaging, Mark McLoughlin wrote a blog post discussing his ideas about upstream packaging, and how it would affect the RDO project. That post is at <https://blogs.gnome.org/markmc/2015/06/12/rdo-and-upstream-packaging/> and the ensuing discussion may be found at <https://www.redhat.com/archives/rdo-list/2015-June/msg00062.html>

Jakub drew up a diagram to explain the packaging workflow, which you can see at <https://www.rdoproject.org/packaging/rdo-packaging.html> And there was a little discussion at <https://www.redhat.com/archives/rdo-list/2015-June/msg00081.html>

One of the CentOS Google Summer of Code projects is closely related to RDO. GSoC student Asad asked some questions about how to handle his Cloud In A Box project, and got some good advice. We look forward to seeing his end product. You can read that conversation at <https://www.redhat.com/archives/rdo-list/2015-June/msg00090.html>

And Jakub also posted about the new rdopkg requirements management documentation which you can see at the following places in the packaging doc:

*   <https://www.rdoproject.org/packaging/rdopkg/rdopkg-adv-requirements.7.html>
*   <https://www.rdoproject.org/packaging/rdopkg/rdopkg.1.html#_action_query>
*   <https://www.rdoproject.org/packaging/rdo-packaging.html#_requirements_management>

This discussion may be seen at <https://www.redhat.com/archives/rdo-list/2015-June/msg00157.html>

You can always find the archives at <https://www.redhat.com/archives/rdo-list/>, or join the list yourself at <https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/rdo-list>

Packaging updates =================

Remember that every week there are two IRC meetings on the topic of packaging. The RDO-specific meeting is every Wednesday at 15:00 UTC. And on Thursdays at 15:00 UTC, the CentOS Cloud SIG discusses issues related to the CentOS CI and packaging infrastructure, as well as other cloud projects that are using those resources. We welcome your participation in either (or both!) of these meetings.

The meetings from the latest RDO packaging meeting may be found at <https://www.redhat.com/archives/rdo-list/2015-June/msg00087.html> and the minutes from the latest Cloud SIG meeting are at <https://www.redhat.com/archives/rdo-list/2015-June/msg00100.html>

Meetups and Events ==================

Each week we post the upcoming OpenStack meetups to the rdo-list mailing list, and also on the RDO website at <http://rdoproject.org/Events> If you have events that you'd like for us to help you publicize, please let me know at rbowen@redhat.com

Last week, RDO had a presence at the Red Hat Summit in Boston, where we gave out hundreds of RDO tshirts and demoed RDO, RDO-Manager, ManageIQ, and various other related things.
