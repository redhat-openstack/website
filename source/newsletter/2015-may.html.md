## RDO Test Day

With Kilo out (more on this below), we need help testing, so that we can make RDO as solid as possible.

We will be holding the Kilo RDO test day on May 5th and 6th, and would greatly appreciate your help in this. We'll be coordinating on #rdo on the Freenode IRC network, and on the rdo-list mailing list - <http://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/rdo-list> - for any questions you may have.

Details about the test day are developing in the wiki, at <https://www.rdoproject.org/RDO_test_day_Kilo> Test cases and documentation will be appearing there over the coming few days.

Please help us by setting aside an hour or two to help test a scenario or two, to solidify the RDO release. Thanks!

## OpenStack Summit

We're just days away from the OpenStack Summit and OpenStack Liberty Design Summit. We'll be in Booth H4, under the big RDO sign. Drop by and get your free RDO tshirt. We'll also have demos of RDO-manager - <https://www.rdoproject.org/RDO-Manager> - and the downstream Red Hat OpenStack Platform product.

We're also hoping to have an RDO meetup (details pending), where we'll discuss the direction of RDO, and how you can get more involved. The agenda for that meeting is available at <https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/RDO_Vancouver> for you to add your ideas and register your interest.

OpenStack Summit is where the direction of the next major release of OpenStack, codenamed Liberty, will be discussed. Thousands of OpenStack developers and operators will be gathering in Vancouver, and you can still be part of that if you register now at <http://tm3.org/summit-register>

## Technical Committee Elections

Congratulations to everyone elected in the recent TC election. (See <http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2015-April/063000.html> for the full results.) In particular, a big shout out to Flavio Percoco, who is a prominent member of the RDO community, and a big contributor to the Zaqar project. We look forward to your leadership in this critical part of OpenStack governance.
