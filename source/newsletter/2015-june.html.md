OpenStack Summit, RDO Meetup, and Tokyo

OpenStack Summit was, as always, a firehose of content, events, and people.

You can watch the keynotes, and any other sessions that you missed - because it's impossible to make it to everything - at <https://www.openstack.org/summit/vancouver-2015/summit-videos/> including Mark McLoughlin's 'The True Meaning of Support' - <http://tm3.org/markmc-vancouver-keynote> , Adrian Otto's great '7 Habits of Effective Contributors' - <http://tm3.org/effecive-contributors> - and Sean and Jon's excellent talk on Enterprise Storage in OpenStack - <http://tm3.org/enterprise-storage>

A highlight of the Summit for me was the RDO Community Meetup. You may remember that we first did this in Paris. Unlike Paris, however, in Vancouver we actually had a room and a spot on the schedule, so we weren't just trying to be heard over the din, but were actually able to discuss the issues and hear one another. The notes from that meetup can be found at <https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/RDO_Vancouver> and the audio from the event is on SoundCloud at <https://soundcloud.com/rich-bowen/sets/rdo-community-meetup-openstack> You can also see my summary of the event at <http://tm3.org/rdo-vancouver>

The meeting was very well attended, with perhaps 60 people there, and, encouragingly, there were a substantial number of people from outside of Red Hat in attendance, since the diversity of this community is very important to us, and we want to see more organizations represented.

Important topics discussed included RDO Manager, the CentOS infrastructure and Cloud SIG, CI, and Packaging.

I would strongly encourage you to have a look over our notes, and bring your questions and comments back to rdo-list.

We'll be gathering for another OpenStack Summit in six months in Tokyo. Other future events were announced from stage at Summit - Austin in the Spring of 2016, and Barcelona in the Autumn of 2016. Hopefully we'll see you at one of those.

OpenStack Liberty

The Design Summit is perhaps the most important part of the OpenStack Summit, in that it is there that it is decided what the next version of OpenStack will look like. With the OpenStack ecosystem of projects continually growing, it can be really hard to keep track of what the plans are.

Here are some key articles you might want to read to undertand what's coming.

Vulnerability Management for OpenStack Liberty cycle, by Tristan Cacqueray - <http://tm3.org/h>

Also of great interest is some of the decisions at a cross-project level that came out of summit, including the decision to stop doing the stable point releases. You can read more about this in this mailing list post by Thierry Carrez - <http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2015-May/065144.html>

You can also watch/listen more about the changes to upcoming releases that have been proposed by the Technical Committee (TC) in the 'Big Tent' presentation at <http://tm3.org/big-tent>

These changes to governance will no doubt effect the way that RDO does packaging in the future, and this was a topic discussed at the RDO Community Meetup in Vancover (see above). So if you're interested in seeing a particular project packaged as part of RDO, you should show up on the mailing list and talk about it.

OpenStack Israel

We're less than 2 weeks away from OpenStack Israel. <http://www.openstack-israel.org/> It's one of the premier events in the OpenStack world, gathering experts from various companies and continents. Israel has a vibrant OpenStack community, and this is always a well-attended event. There's still time to register, at <http://www.openstack-israel.org/>#!register/c24vq but hurry, there's only a few remaining tickets.

Meetups

Each week we post the upcoming OpenStack meetups to rdo-list, and to the RDO website, at <http://rdoproject.org/Events>

We want to hear from you about the events that you've attended, and especially the ones that you're speaking at, so that we can continue to promote upcoming events and grow the community.
