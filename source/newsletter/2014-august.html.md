# 2014 August

**Not on the rdo-newsletter distribution list? [Subscribe HERE.](http://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/rdo-newsletter)**

Thanks again for being part of the RDO community! Here's some of what's going on in the community.

**VOTE for the OpenStack Summit schedule**

There's just one day left for you to influence what presentations will be at the OpenStack Summit in Paris in November. To vote, go to [<https://www.openstack.org/vote-paris/>](https://www.openstack.org/vote-paris/) and dive right in. (You'll need an openstack.org account.)

There's a \*huge\* number of talks that have been submitted, so it can take a long time to get through them all. You can search for a particular topic that you're interested in, to narrow the list a little.

If you're particularly interested in OpenStack on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, and Fedora, you can find presentations by Red Hat engineers listed at [<http://redhatstackblog.redhat.com/2014/07/31/session-voting-now-open-for-openstack-summit-paris/>](http://redhatstackblog.redhat.com/2014/07/31/session-voting-now-open-for-openstack-summit-paris/)

Remember, the vote closes on Wednesday, August 6, so don't wait!

**Flock starts tomorrow!**

Flock, the Fedora Contributor Conference, starts tomorrow, August 6, in Prague, Czech Republic. It's a gathering of everyone who cares about Fedora, for technical sessions, planning for the future, and community networking.

On Saturday (August 9), Jakub Ruzicka will be leading a two hour workshop on configuring a two-node KVM-based OpenStack setup using VMs. If you're going to be there, this is a great opportunity to get a deeper understanding of OpenStack, Neutron networking, and virtualization in general.

You can see more information about the session at <http://sched.co/1kI1BWf> and more information about the Flock conference at <http://flocktofedora.org/>

**Juno mid-cycle meetups**

Over the last few weeks, several of the OpenStack projects held mid-cycle meetups, to discuss how progress is going toward Juno, and what needs to happen between now and October.

We've had updates from several of these projects, and there are more on the way. Here's a few of those reports:

Juno Preview for OpenStack Compute (Nova) by Russell Bryant: <http://blog.russellbryant.net/2014/07/07/juno-preview-for-openstack-compute-nova/>

The mid-cycle state of Ceilometer, with Eoghan Glynn: <http://community.redhat.com/blog/2014/07/upstream-podcast-episode-10-rich-bowen-with-eoghan-glynn-on-openstack-juno/>

OpenStack Orchestration (Heat), with Zane Bitter: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwuZHMkFzFs&list=UUQ74G2gKXdpwZkXEsclzcrA#t=1343>

Image (Glance) and Messaging/Notification (Marconi) Juno Previews, with Flavio Percoco: <http://blog.flaper87.com/post/juno-preview-glance-marconi/>

Security, with Nathan Kinder - <http://redhatstackblog.redhat.com/2014/08/05/juno-updates-security/>

To catch other mid-cycle previews as they come in, just follow us on Twitter, at @rdocommunity and watch for updates on <http://rdoproject.org/Juno_previews>

**OSCON**

Two weeks ago was the always-fun O'Reilly Open Source Convention, OSCON, in Portland, Oregon. RDO had a demo stand, and a steady stream of people came by to talk with us, and get the TryStack.org T-shirt and other RDO swag.

If you were at OSCON, thanks for stopping by and chatting. We'd love to hear from you about your conference experience, what you learned about OpenStack, and what you'd like to see us do differently next year.

On Tuesday night, there was a party to celebrate OpenStack's fourth birthday party - OpenStack was launched four years ago at OSCON.

And there was a lot of great content at the conference, about OpenStack and every other Open Source project you care about. This year, all of the content from the event will be available on YouTube, so that if you missed anything, or if you want to see it again, you can. When it's ready, all of that video will be available at <http://www.oscon.com/oscon2014/public/content/video>

I've posted a few photos from the booth on the G+ group at <http://tm3.org/rdogplus>

**LinuxCon**

In just a few weeks, RDO will be at LinuxCon in Chicago - <http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/linuxcon-north-america> Drop by the Red Hat booth to talk to us about RDO, and see a demo of RDO in action.

And, if you're in Europe, LinuxCon Dusseldorf is coming very soon - <http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/linuxcon-europe> - in the middle of OCtober. So save the date, and we hope to see you there.

**Hangouts**

In July, Eoghan Glynn gave us an overview of what's planned for Ceilometer in the Juno cycle in the RDO hangout. If you missed that, you can still watch it at <https://plus.google.com/events/c6e8vjjn8klrf78ruhkr95j4tas> If you have any followup questions, stop by #rdo or #openstack-ceilometer on the Freenode IRC network, where there's always someone that can help you out.

Stay tuned to @rdocommunity on Twitter to hear about our plans for a hangout in August, or see the Hangouts page on the RDO website, at <http://rdoproject.org/Hangouts>
