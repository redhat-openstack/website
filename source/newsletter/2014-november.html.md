# 2014 November

Hi, and thanks for being part of the RDO community.

Here's some of what's going on in the RDO world lately, including blog posts, meetups, and the OpenStack Summit in Paris.

Quick links:

*   Quick Start - <http://rdoproject.org/quickstart>
*   RDO packages - <https://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/openstack/openstack-juno/>
*   RDO blog - <http://rdoproject.org/blog>
*   Open bugs - <http://tm3.org/rdobugs-20141030>

RDO Juno packages available

OpenStack Juno released on October 16th, and it took us a few days to package it up for RDO.

We're pleased to announce the availability of RDO packages for OpenStack Juno, for EL7 (RHEL7 and CentOS7) and Fedora 20.

Fedora 21 is still in development and running RDO Juno on Fedora 21 is not recommended at this time. A separate announcement will be made when RDO Juno on Fedora 21 is ready.

You can get started with RDO Juno via the process described in the Quickstart - <http://rdoproject.org/Quickstart> - and the various packages are available at <https://rdo.fedorapeople.org/openstack-juno/>

As always, if you have questions, you can bring them here, to the rdo-list mailing list, or to the IRC channel - #rdo on freenode.irc.net.

Events

This week, many of us are in Paris for the OpenStack 'Kilo' Summit, where the next version of OpenStack will be planned, and many OpenStack technical sessions will cover all aspects of running and developing OpenStack.

If you're here in Paris, please drop by the Red Hat booth, at A1, to pick up your Red Hat cap and see demos of OpenStack and related projects.

If you're interested in being more involved in the RDO project, join us for at lunch time on Wednesday in the corner by the Red Hat booth. where we'll be discussing how you can participate in packaging, documentation, and testing, among other things. We'd love to hear from you where we can improve and be more welcoming. Look for the RDO sign! And if you drop by today, we have just a few RDO tshirts left.

If you're running OpenStack on RHEL, CentOS, or Fedora, the talks you're going to want to catch are listed at <http://tm3.org/blog32>

Several "must see" sessions are:

The Open NFV Organization, Neutron, and OpenDaylight - <https://openstacksummitnovember2014paris.sched.org/event/b985d5b656a13007c80f54253b675785>

Meetups

If you're not able to make it to Paris this week, remember that there are hundreds of OpenStack meetups every month, and we highlight a few of them every week on the rdo-list mailing list, as well as listing them on the RDO Events page at <http://rdoproject.org/Events>

If you're running a Meetup, or attending one, we'd love to hear about it, so that we can help you get the word out. Add them to the events page, and drop me an email.

Hangouts

Unfortunately, we didn't manage to do a hangout in October, but we are planning to do one this month. If there's a particular topic that you'd like to see us do a hangout about, watch for a thread about this in the coming days on the rdo-list mailing list, where you can speak up.

You can watch all of our past hangouts at <https://rdoproject.org/Hangouts#Past_Hangouts>
