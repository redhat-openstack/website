### OpenStack Liberty Summit

Last month, I mentioned that the vote was ongoing for the name of the 'L' release of OpenStack. In case you missed it, the winner, by a tiny margin over Lizard, was Liberty. OpenStack Kilo will be released on April 30th, and on May 18th we'll meet in Vancouver, Canada, to begin the work towards OpenStack Liberty.

If you've contributed any patches towards the Kilo release, you should by now have received your tickets to the Liberty summit. You can find out more about the event, and register, at <https://www.openstack.org/summit/vancouver-2015/>

The CFP - Call For Papers - closed a few weeks ago, and the schedule of presentations is being selected right now. Watch the various OpenStack mailing lists for details as they become available.

The nominations for the OpenStack SuperUser awards are now open, too. If there's some organization that you think deserves to be recognized for the way that they're using OpenStack to make their industry, or the world, better, you have until March 17th to nominate them for this recognition: <http://superuser.openstack.org/articles/superuser-awards-nominations-now-open>

As always, RDO will be at OpenStack Summit in force. Come by early in the show to be sure to get one of our great new RDO tshirts, and the updated OpenStack command line cheatsheet bookmarks. We'll be at the Red Hat booth.

We're hoping to see you there!

### Packaging

The RDO community packaging effort is gaining momentum, with more community members stepping up to participate. If you're interested in helping with the packaging effort, plan to come to the packaging meeting on the #RDO IRC channel, on Freenode, Wednesday at 15:00 UTC. Details at <https://www.redhat.com/archives/rdo-list/2015-March/msg00004.html>

### Hangouts and Meetups

Each week there are dozens of OpenStack hangouts around the planet. You can see a list of these each Monday morning at <http://rdoproject.org/Events>

If you're attending any of these events, please take a few photos, and take a moment afterwards to write up what happened at the meetup - who spoke, and what they talked about - and drop a note to rdo-list, or directly to me.

In February, we had one Google Hangout, in which Eoghan Glynn talked about the Gnocci project - an effort to rework the way that Ceilometer stores data, for greater efficiency - both storage and speed. You can watch this presentation on YouTube at <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdphlN9Juk0>

And stay tuned for upcoming Hangouts. As the Kilo cycle draws to a close, we'll have more projects reporting on their progress in this version, and what you can expect to find when it releases.

### Keep in touch

There's lots of ways to stay in in touch with what's going in in the RDO community. The best ways are ...

*   Follow us on Twitter - <http://twitter.com/rdocommunity>
*   Google+ - <http://tm3.org/rdogplus>
*   Facebook - <http://facebook.com/rdocommunity>
*   rdo-list mailing list - <http://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/rdo-list>
*   This newsletter - <http://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/rdo-newsletter>
*   RDO Q&A - <http://ask.openstack.org/>
*   IRC - #rdo on Freenode.irc.net

Finally, remember that the OpenStack User Survey is always open, so every time you deploy a new OpenStack cloud, go update your records at <https://www.openstack.org/user-survey/> so that, when Vancouver rolls around, we have a clearer picture of the OpenStack usage out in the wild.

Thanks again for being part of the RDO community!
