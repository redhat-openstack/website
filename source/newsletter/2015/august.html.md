## Mailing List Update

Here's what's been going on in the RDO world since you last heard from me.

*   Asadullah Hussain, who is working on a "Cloud In A Box" bootable

image, as part of the Google Summer of Code, has given a few updates on his progress. You can read his latest update at <https://www.redhat.com/archives/rdo-list/2015-July/msg00066.html> and <https://www.redhat.com/archives/rdo-list/2015-July/msg00026.html>

With the end of the Summer of Code approaching, if you want to help Asad in his endeavors, please step up.

*   At the first RDO packaging meeting of the month - minutes at

<https://www.redhat.com/archives/rdo-list/2015-July/msg00005.html> - there was a discussion of whether we would continue to try to make RDO packages part of Fedora, or ship them as a separate repository, giving us greater freedom of release schedule. This followed on from the conversation at the OpenStack Summit in Vancouver.

*   Sandro Mathys started a conversation about including MidoNet in

RDO Manager, and this has generated quite a bit of discussion, at <https://www.redhat.com/archives/rdo-list/2015-July/msg00112.html>

*   There was a brief discussion of the vote for sessions at the

upcoming OpenStack Summit in Tokyo. That vote is now closed, and we should see the schedule for that event very soon at <http://openstack.org/summit>

## RDO Blogs

There are a number of very prolific bloggers in the RDO community. Each week I try to post the highlights to the mailing list, and you can see those lists here:

*   <https://www.redhat.com/archives/rdo-list/2015-August/msg00011.html>

Of those, I'd like to particularly draw your attention to a few posts:

### Dive into Zuul – Gated commit system by Fabien Boucher

Zuul is a software developed by the OpenStack community. It was developed as an efficient gated commit system, allowing projects to merge patches only after they pass a series of tests. It reduces the probability of breaking the master branch, for instance when unit tests or functional tests no longer pass on the tip of master.

### Inside Cinder’s Incremental Backup, by Gorka Eguileor

I’ve been asked a couple of times how Cinder’s Incremental Backup works and what do I actually mean when I say we need to rework Ceph’s Backup driver to support Cinder’s Incremental Backup. So I’ll try to explain both in this post.

### Containerize OpenStack with Docker by Ryan Hallisey

Today in the cloud space, a lot of buzz in the market stems from Docker and providing support for launching containers on top of an existing platform. However, what is often overlooked is the use of Docker to improve deployment of the infrastructure platforms themselves; in other words, the ability to ship your cloud in containers.

### A journey of a packet within OpenContrail by Sylvain Afchain

In this post we will see how a packet generated by a VM is able to reach another VM or an external resource, what are the key concepts/components in the context of Neutron using the OpenContrail plugin. We will focus on OpenContrail, how it implements the overlay and the tools that it provides to check/troubleshoot how the packet are forwarded. Before getting started, I’ll give a little overview of the key concepts of OpenContrail.

### From 0 to OpenStack with devtest: the process in details, by Yanis Guenane

Devtest is the upstream way to deploy Openstack with TripleO. In simple words it takes you from a fresh bare metal server to an overcloud (understand OpenStack cloud) up and running with a single script.

### NUMA and CPU Pinning in High Throughput Computing, by Tim Bell

CERN's OpenStack cloud runs the Juno release on mainly CentOS 7 hypervisors. Along with previous tuning options described in this blog which can be used on Juno, a number of further improvements have been delivered in Kilo.
