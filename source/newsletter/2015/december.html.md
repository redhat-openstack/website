## FOSDEM and RDO Community Day

FOSDEM is just a few weeks away. As you may know, FOSDEM is held every
year in Brussels, on the last weekend in January. It's an incredibly
dense event, where about 5000 free software enthusiasts gather for
technical content, various social events, and lots of beer.

You can find out more about FOSDEM [on the FOSDEM website](https://fosdem.org/2016/) but as
it's a free event, you don't need to register. Just show up.

On the day before FOSDEM - that's January 29 - members of the RDO
community will gather at the IBM Client Center in Brussels for the RDO
Community Day, a full day of RDO-centric presentations and
discussions, for the entire RDO community. We would be delighted if
you would join us.

More information about the event is available [on the RDO blog](https://www.rdoproject.org/blog/2015/11/rdo-community-day-fosdem/)
including the call for presentations, which closes this Friday, so get
your ideas in as soon as possible. If you're planning to attend,
please [register](http://tm3.org/rdo-fosdem-16) so that we know how
many to expect for lunch.

We'll be publishing the event schedule to the RDO blog as soon as it's
finalized, which should be before Christmas.

Also, if you'd like to present a talk in the larger IaaS
(Infrastructure as a Service) devroom at FOSDEM, the CFP for that 
closes on Tuesday December 8th, and can be found [here](https://lists.fosdem.org/pipermail/fosdem/2015-October/002197.html)

## RDO Mitaka 1 Test Day

The OpenStack Mitaka cycle is well under way, and milestone 1 is due
this week. We're planning to do a test day next week of the RDO
packages built from this milestone, including the RDO Manager
deployment and management tool.

This test day will run December 10th and 11th, and we'll be gathering
on #rdo on the Freenode IRC network for questions and discussion.

We'll also be available for anybody that wants to try the [Liberty Quickstart](http://rdoproject.org/quickstart/)to stand up an OpenStack Liberty cloud using RDO.

More information about the RDO Test Day is [here](https://www.rdoproject.org/testday/rdo-test-day-mitaka-01/)

## The month on rdo-list

The first month of a new OpenStack cycle does tend to be a little slow
on rdo-list, and this month was no exception, with discussion down a
little from the previous few months, with 56 participants in 65
topics.

There were, however, a number of important discussions worth mentioning.

I mentioned a blog post about the RDO community meetup at OpenStack
Summit in Tokyo. That post is [here](https://www.rdoproject.org/blog/2015/11/community-meetup-at-openstack-tokyo/)
and outlines some of the major topics that were discussed. It also
includes a complete recording of the meetup, for those of you that
missed it.

There were a number of good discussions of RDO-Manager - getting it
working, the progress of the project, and next steps. As I mentioned
above, RDO-Manager will be part of the RDO Test Day next week, if you
want to give it at try.

For those interested in the Shade library, there was a discussion of
that [here](https://www.redhat.com/archives/rdo-list/2015-November/msg00054.html)

Haikel started a conversation about automatic restarts for services
which developed into a fairly long thread, which you can see [here](https://www.redhat.com/archives/rdo-list/2015-November/msg00101.html)

The entire RDO-List mailing list archives are available [here](https://www.redhat.com/archives/rdo-list/index.html)

## RDO Liberty released in CentOS Cloud SIG

We are pleased to announce the general availability of the RDO build
for OpenStack Liberty for CentOS Linux 7 x86_64, suitable for building
private, public and hybrid clouds. OpenStack Liberty is the 12th
release of the open source software collaboratively built by a large
number of contributors around the OpenStack.org project space.

You can read more about this release on the [RDO blog](https://www.rdoproject.org/blog/2015/10/rdo-liberty-released-in-centos-cloud-sig/)
as well as instructions on getting started deploying OpenStack on
CentOS using RDO.
