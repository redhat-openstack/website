---
Pour your favorite seasonal local brew into a Stein cause we're solidly into the [new release schedule](https://releases.openstack.org/stein/schedule.html) - we're talking about the rpm-packaging project, excited to see another round of Outreachy applicants, and gearing up for OpenStack Summit Berlin.

## <a name="housekeeping"></a>Housekeeping Items
### Volunteers Needed for the RDO Booth at OpenStack Summit Berlin
We are gearing up for [OpenStack Summit Berlin](https://www.openstack.org/summit/berlin-2018/) where we'll have our regular presence within the Red Hat booth. This fall we'll continue the ManageIQ / RDO demo we started last year and we'd love to see your demos, too! If you've got something you'd like to demo via video OR LIVE because you're not afraid of ANYTHING, [sign up](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/rdo-vancouver-summit-booth).

We're also looking for people to spend their precious free time [answering questions](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/berlin-summit-community-pod) at the RDO booth. If you're attending, please consider spending one or more of your free moments with us. Questions run the gamut from "What's RDO?" to "I found a bug in Neutron and need help troubleshooting it." Of course, you're not expected to know everything and you can always keep IRC open to access the RDO Community for help! Plus, you get cool stuff! If you show up for three or more shifts, we're going to hook you up with an RDO hoodie.

Reach out to Rain Leander on IRC (leanderthal) or email (rain@redhat.com) for more information.

### The OpenStack RPM-packaging Project
Javier Pena started a discussion on the dev mailing list regarding our involvement in the [rpm-packaging project](https://github.com/openstack/rpm-packaging), specifically regarding how we collaborate with people from other rpm-based distributions. We have been successful in [reusing some tools](https://github.com/openstack/pymod2pkg) [created by that project](https://github.com/openstack/renderspec) but we've never been able to reuse the spec file templates generated by the project, besides openstack-macros and some python 3 tests done during the Rocky cycle.

As a community, we need to decide what we want our involvement in the project to be:

* Only get involved in the tooling side, if we have no plans to reuse the spec templates in the future.
* Try a deeper integration with the specs.
* Other alternatives?

Each option will carry its own consequences, e.g. if we stop contributing to the spec templates we should stop the 3rd party CI jobs and VMs that support them. The conversation continues [on the dev list](https://lists.rdoproject.org/pipermail/dev/2018-September/008901.html), but we’d like to make a decision shortly. 

If you’re keen, please join us at the weekly community meeting on #rdo on Freenode irc. Or reply directly on the [dev mailing list](https://lists.rdoproject.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

### Tentative Stein Test Dates Listed
The tentative Stein test day schedule is [posted](https://www.rdoproject.org/testday/) - please mention serious conflicts to Rain rain@redhat.com so we can fix them before the the first milestone hits Next Month.

* Milestone1 01-02 November 2018
* Milestone3 14-15 March 2019

### Community Meetings
Every Wednesday at 15:00 UTC, we have the weekly RDO community meeting on the #RDO channel on Freenode IRC. The agenda for this meeting is posted each week in a [public etherpad](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/RDO-Meeting) and the minutes from the meeting are posted [on the RDO website](https://www.rdoproject.org/community/community-meeting/). If there's something you'd like to see happen in RDO - a package that is missing, a tool that you'd like to see included, or a change in how things are governed - this is the best time and place to help make that happen.

Every Thursday at 15:00 UTC, there is a weekly **CentOS Cloud SIG meeting** on the #centos-devel channel on Freenode IRC. The agenda for this meeting is posted each week in a [public etherpad](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/centos-cloud-sig) and the minutes from the meeting are posted [on the RDO website](https://www.rdoproject.org/contribute/cloud-sig-meeting/). This meeting makes sense for people that are involved in packaging OpenStack for CentOS and for people that are packaging OTHER cloud infra thingies (OpenNebula, CloudStack, Euca, etc) for CentOS. “Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.” - Helen Keller

### Call for OpenStack Outreachy Applicants
OpenStack provides open source software for building public and private clouds. We are constantly moving and growing and very excited to invite newcomers to our community. To this end, the OpenStack Foundation has joined the program [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) 

Outreachy helps people from groups underrepresented in free and open source software get involved. We provide a supportive community for beginning to contribute any time throughout the year and offer focused internship opportunities twice a year with a number of free software organizations.

The current round of internships is open internationally to women (cis and trans), trans men, and genderqueer people. Additionally, it's open to residents and nationals of the United States of any gender who are Black/African American, Hispanic/Latin@, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander. We are planning to expand the program to more participants from underrepresented backgrounds in the future.

The application process is described in detail at [https://www.outreachy.org/apply](https://www.outreachy.org/apply). A contribution is required and you answer questions when you apply. You are expected to work full-time on the internship although you can indicate any pre-planned time off in your application.

In order to make your application stronger, here are a few things you could consider including:

* Previously worked projects/coding experience. If it is docs, related experience if any
* What do you intend to learn from the selected project? Or rationale behind choosing the specific project
* How do you think this internship is going to help you achieve what you wanted?
* Your next choice of projects if your first choice is not available

Also include information or link on your merged patch (which is a requirement to be considered for the internship). Please be available and responsive throughout the application period so we can work with you on improving your application. The timeline for this round is:

Sept. 19, 2018  Applicants start making contributions to internship projects
Oct. 30, 2018   Application deadline
Nov. 16, 2018   Accepted interns announced
Dec. 4, 2018 to March 4, 2019  Internships period

### CentOS Dojo / RDO Day at CERN
We’re super excited to host an [RDO Day in conjunction with a CentOS Dojo](https://indico.cern.ch/event/727150/) at [CERN](https://home.cern/). The CentOS Dojos and RDO Days are one day events, organized around the world, that bring together people from the CentOS Communities and RDO Communities to talk about systems administration, OpenStack, best practices in Linux centric activities, and emerging technologies of note. The emphasis is to find local speakers and tutors to come together and talk about things that they care about most, and to share stories from their experiences working with CentOS in various scenarios.
