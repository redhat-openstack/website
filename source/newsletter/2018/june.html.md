Welcome to June! If you’re like me, you’re looking around in bewilderment, wondering how that happened and if it’s possible to go back in time a few months. But here we are! May was a fun-filled month, with both Red Hat and OpenStack Summits in addition to a lot of local events sprinkled in between, as well as the election of the Rocky TC and the re-launch of the CentOS Pulse Newsletter. Read below for more information on all of this and more.

### Upcoming Test Days
Our next test day is [June 14-15](https://www.rdoproject.org/testday/rocky/milestone2/) - Rocky Milestone 2! For more information on these test days and how to participate, keep an eye out on the dev@ list for details, reach out to Rain via [email](rain@redhat.com) or IRC (leanderthal).

Of course, you don't have to wait for a scheduled test day to test RDO. We would love to hear about your experiences, with either a [Packstack installation](https://www.rdoproject.org/install/packstack) or the [TripleO Quickstart](https://www.rdoproject.org/tripleo).

We also encourage you to work through the [upstream installation tutorial](https://docs.openstack.org/queens/install/) while keeping detailed notes on the following points:

* Did you know what the document assumed that you'd know?
* Did the steps work as described?
* What error conditions did you encounter? Could you work around them? If so, how?
* When you were done, did it work as expected? If not, what happened, and how did it differ from what you expected to happen?

### General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
Within the RDO Community and Red Hat, your privacy is important and we will continue to be transparent about what information we collect, how we use it, and about your rights in managing that information. However, because of the high demands made by the GDPR, a law passed in the European Union, we have made some explicit changes in our privacy statement: [https://www.rdoproject.org/legal/privacy/](https://www.rdoproject.org/legal/privacy/).

If there are any questions, concerns, or requests to see your data or opt-out, please email [privacy@rdoproject.org](privacy@rdoproject.org).

### Cloud SIG and the CentOS Pulse
As part of the Cloud SIG community outreach effort, Rich Bowen is rebooting the [CentOS Pulse newsletter](https://wiki.centos.org/Newsletter/), which was discontinued about 8 years ago. The purpose of this newsletter is to provide a high-level update on what CentOS is up to, to the peripheral audience - including the tech press - who are less connected with the daily life of the project.

If your SIG would like to provide an update, or if you have something else you'd like to share with this audience, please email [Rich](rbowen@redhat.com) with any relevant information.

### Community Meetings
Every Wednesday at 15:00 UTC, we have the weekly RDO community meeting on the #RDO channel on Freenode IRC. The agenda for this meeting is posted each week in a [public etherpad](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/RDO-Meeting) and the minutes from the meeting are posted [on the RDO website](https://www.rdoproject.org/community/community-meeting/). If there's something you'd like to see happen in RDO - a package that is missing, a tool that you'd like to see included, or a change in how things are governed - this is the best time and place to help make that happen.

### OpenStack Community Contributor Awards
The [OpenStack Community Contributor Awards](http://superuser.openstack.org/articles/openstack-community-contributor-awards-vancouver/) were announced on the last day of OpenStack Summit. From long-time contributors and core maintainers to hotel staff who helped when unexpected weather conditions impacted the Dublin PTG, we appreciate you all! 

As they said in the announcement, “our community is not just developers... but developers, operators, users and those who interact with all of us,” and we couldn’t agree more. We’d like to recognize our contributors by giving shout outs in THIS NEWSLETTER - if you see awesomeness within the community, be sure to let us know.

### 2018 OpenStack User Survey
If you’re running OpenStack, please take part in the [2018 OpenStack User Survey](https://www.openstack.org/user-survey/survey-2018/landing?BackURL=/user-survey/survey-2018/). The survey is available in 7 languages -- English, German, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, traditional Chinese and simplified Chinese -- and the results will be published in October, prior to the Berlin OpenStack Summit.

The deadline to complete the survey and be part of the next report is **Friday, August 3 at 23:59 UTC.** You can login and complete the OpenStack User Survey here: [http://www.openstack.org/user-survey](http://www.openstack.org/user-survey).

### OpenStack Technical Committee Election Results
Congratulations to the 7 newly elected members of the Rocky Technical Committee (TC)! With this round of elections, we welcomed Thierry Carrez, Chris Dent, Sean McGinnis, Davanum Srinivas, Zane Bitter, Graham Hayes, and Mohammed Naser.

Want more information? View the [full election results](https://civs.cs.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/results.pl?id=E_98430d99fc2ed59d) as well as the [election process details](https://governance.openstack.org/election/).

Interested in how the TC has worked in the past? [Check out the retrospective](http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2018-May/130835.html) from the last 6 months, recently posted on the OpenStack-dev mailing list.

### Red Hat Summit
With how busy the rest of May has been, it seems like Red Hat Summit (May 7-9) was a lifetime ago! From demo’ing our [cross-team hardware project](https://twitter.com/rainleander/status/991047862543962118) (hat tip to ManageIQ & Ceph for the collaboration!) to attending amazing talks and of course giving out the [classic RDO ducks](https://twitter.com/manageiq/status/994266142561550336), it was a fantastic 3 days.

Special thanks to Molly Kepley and our small army of RDO community volunteers (huge shout out to Carol Chen, Brett Niver, Michael Hackett, Vikhyat Umrao, John Wilkins, Sébastien Han, T. Nichole Williams, and Ju Lim) who held down the fort at the RDO booth throughout the Summit.

### SuperSec 2018
[Pablo Iranzo](https://iranzo.github.io), PSME on OpenStack Support, recently presented on [Citellus](https://citellus.org) at [SuperSec 2018](https://supersec.es/) in Almería, Spain. The presentation was part of SuperSec 2018, a Congress on Secure Software Development, where the focus was on all the security implications on software, from a legal point of view, to coding, best practices, and of course, lifecycle, where Citellus was a fit.

Citellus analyzes known issues on systems based on simple-to-write tests. It’s created by Red Hat and available in github for use and contribution. It has been used by several teams to quickly detect known issues and reduce fix time or give proactive insights on what could happen in the future. It not only works in Red Hat products, but with upstream versions like RDO, CentOS, and Fedora, and also has some initial support for running on Debian, Arch Linux, etc, on top of the regular RHEL6, 7 and RHOSP support (among others).

You can find the slides from Pablo’s talk [on Github](https://github.com/citellusorg/citellus/blob/master/doc/supersec2018-presentation-ES.md) and keep an eye on his [blog](https://iranzo.github.io/blog/2018/05/13/supersec/) for a recording of
the talk.

### OpenStack Summit Vancouver
OpenStack Summit (May 21-24) quickly followed Red Hat Summit and we again had an amazing group of volunteers who helped staff the RDO booth: Haïkel Guémar, Carol Chen, Leo Vaz, Dan Sneddon, T. Nichole Williams, Michael Turek, David Simard, Victoria MartÃ­nez de la Cruz, and Rodrigo Freire.

Haïkel was our amazing RDO ambassador and wrote out a lovely summary of the week: [https://blogs.rdoproject.org/2018/06/rdo-duck-adventures-at-the-vancouver-openstack-summit/](https://blogs.rdoproject.org/2018/06/rdo-duck-adventures-at-the-vancouver-openstack-summit/).

We recreated the awesome hardware demo with ManageIQ and Ceph, which proved to be a big hit, and had an amazing time hanging out with the [Ceph crew](https://twitter.com/JenInnovate/status/999463166764609536) for an evening of tech and community.

As always, the [RDO ducks](https://twitter.com/JenInnovate/status/999001254389936128) were a [big attraction](https://twitter.com/hguemar/status/999409253768024064) and went on [a few adventures](https://twitter.com/danvanderster/status/1001259097407111168) of their own, both [during](https://twitter.com/hguemar/status/999076975699513349) and after the conference!

Be sure to keep an eye out for more details about RDO’s presence at [OpenStack Summit Berlin](https://www.openstack.org/summit/berlin-2018/), Nov 13-15, and OpenStack Summit 2019 in Denver.
