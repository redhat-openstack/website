Yes, the newsletter is here. And short. But better late than never, right? With DevConf.IN *AND* DevConf.US passed, August has been an absolutely wild ride, but look, here comes a wild ride this fall with RDO Rocky GA Test Days 5-6 September on #rdo channel on Freenode, OpenStack PTG 10-14 September in Denver Colorado USA, CentOS Dojo and RDO Day at CERN 19 October in Geneva Switzerland, and OpenStack Summit 13-15 November in Berlin Germany. Bucky up, Stackers, it's going to be an adventurous ride!

### RDO Rocky Milestone Three Cancelled
Just before RDO Rocky M3 Test Days, and the weekly RDO Community meeting on Wednesday at 15:00 UTC, the community discussed the pros and cons of fewer official test days. And after discussing it for two meetings, instead of official testing on M1, M2, M3, and GA, we’ll only have test days on M2 and GA. Starting NOW. Therefore, M3 Test Day was cancelled rather last minute, but we look forward to GA Test Days in early September!

### RDO Test Days Changes Frequency!
As we mentioned earlier in [Housekeeping](#housekeeping), we’re switching frequencies from potentially four test days per six month period to two. This will free up bandwidth to focus on collaboration, coding, writing, administration, using, and operating your favorite RPM based version of OpenStack.

Of course, you don't have to wait for a scheduled test day to test RDO. We would love to hear about your experiences, with either a [Packstack installation](https://www.rdoproject.org/install/packstack/) or the [TripleO Quickstart](https://www.rdoproject.org/tripleo/).

We also encourage you to work through the upstream installation tutorial while keeping detailed notes on the following points:
* Did you know what the document assumed that you'd know?
* Did the steps work as described?
* What error conditions did you encounter? Could you work around them? If so, how?
* When you were done, did it work as expected? If not, what happened, and how did it differ from what you expected to happen?

### To PodCast? Or not to podcast? That is the Question
RDO currently has [a podbean account](http://rdocommunity.podbean.com/) where we put any audio that we capture in interviews. However, we almost never actually point to that site, but, insted, embed the player directly in the RDO blog, like [https://www.rdoproject.org/blog/2016/05/what-did-you-do-in-mitaka-adam-young/](https://www.rdoproject.org/blog/2016/05/what-did-you-do-in-mitaka-adam-young/). The podcasts have been largely [replaced by videos](http://youtube.com/RDOCommunity), but we do occasionally still do an audio-only recording. Do we want to keep the podbean account? Do you have a podcast idea that you want to do? If you're keen about keeping the podcast spirit alive, reach out to leanderthal on #rdo Freenode IRC.

### Community Meetings
Every Wednesday at 15:00 UTC, we have the weekly RDO community meeting on the #RDO channel on Freenode IRC. The agenda for this meeting is posted each week in a [public etherpad](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/RDO-Meeting) and the minutes from the meeting are posted [on the RDO website](https://www.rdoproject.org/community/community-meeting/). If there's something you'd like to see happen in RDO - a package that is missing, a tool that you'd like to see included, or a change in how things are governed - this is the best time and place to help make that happen.

Every Thursday at 15:00 UTC, there is a weekly **CentOS Cloud SIG meeting** on the #centos-devel channel on Freenode IRC. The agenda for this meeting is posted each week in a [public etherpad](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/centos-cloud-sig) and the minutes from the meeting are posted [on the RDO website](https://www.rdoproject.org/contribute/cloud-sig-meeting/). This meeting makes sense for people that are involved in packaging OpenStack for CentOS and for people that are packaging OTHER cloud infra thingies (OpenNebula, CloudStack, Euca, etc) for CentOS. “Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.” - Helen Keller

### Interviews at OpenStack Project Team Gathering
The Project Teams Gathering is happening NEXT MONTH in Denver Colorado and we’ll be there! While a lot of people will go to facilitate technical community groups collaborating in one space, our own Rain Leander will zoom out to continue Rich’s interview tradition awesomeness. That’s right, ever since the first PTG - Atlanta February 2017 - RDO has interviewed individuals and projects to hear:

* What you've been working on in the latest release
* Give some idea of what's (what might be?) coming in the upcoming release
* Put a human face on the OpenStack project and encourage new participants to join us

If you’re keen to join, [sign up now](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19XjQPeE9ZobK1b49aM-J7P-xQC-OKLNeFnwxavyQCgU/edit?usp=sharing)! Please note that there are only 55 interview slots available -  consider coordinating with your project to designate the people that you want to represent the project, so that we don't end up with 12 interview about Neutron. 

Not that we don’t love Neutron. But twelve Neutron interviews is a few too many. 

And if you prefer to have company, we can accommodate up to three people per interview. But not twelve people. Definitely not twelve.

See you in Denver!

### OpenStack Diversity and Inclusion Survey
The Diversity and Inclusion Work Group needs YOU! The [Diversity Survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/OpenStackDiversity) that was originally distributed to the Community in the Fall of 2015 is updated and revised. Please take the time to fill out the survey and share it with others in the community. Thank you for assisting in this important task!

## <a name="events"></a>Recent and Upcoming Events
### OpenStack PTG in Denver Colorado
The [Project Teams Gathering (PTG)](https://www.openstack.org/ptg) is an event organized by the OpenStack Foundation. It provides meeting facilities allowing the various technical community groups working with OpenStack (user workgroups, development teams, operators, SIGs) to meet in-person, exchange and get work done in a productive setting. It lets those various groups discuss their priorities for the upcoming cycle, assign work items, iterate quickly on solutions for complex problems, and make fast progress on critical issues. The co-location of those various meetings, combined with the dynamic scheduling of the event, make it easy to get specific people in the same room to discuss a specific topic, or participate in multiple team meetings. Evenings allow for relationship building and problem sharing.

### CentOS Dojo / RDO Day at CERN
On Friday, October 19th, RDO and CentOS will hold a one day event to bring together people from the RDO and CentOS Communities to talk about systems administration, best practices in OpenStack and Linux centric activities as well as emerging technologies of note. The emphasis is to find local speakers and tutors to come together and talk about things that they care about most, and to share stories from their experiences working with RDO and CentOS in various scenarios. Because security is tight, please be sure to [register](https://indico.cern.ch/event/727150/).

### Call For Papers
There are a handful of relevant conferences with open CFPs. Need help figuring out a good topic or finalizing your abstract? Feel free to reach out in the #RDO channel on IRC.

* **FOSDEM Brussels 2-3 February 2019** is a free event for software developers to meet, share ideas and collaborate. Every year, thousands of developers of free and open source software from all over the world gather at the event in Brussels. CFPs for lighting talks - 15 minute long - and are interested in talks on a wide variety of topics. Anyone who has something interesting to say about an open source or free software topic can apply. We particularly encourage topics that do not fit in any of the developer rooms. Proposals for lightning talks should be submitted using [Pentabarf](https://fosdem.org/submit). Please select "lightning Talks" in the"track" field. If you already created an account in the system for a previous edition, please reuse it rather than re-registering. 24 November 2018 is the deadline for lightning talk proposals.
* **DevNexus Atlanta GA 6-8 March 2019** wants to connect developers from all over the world, provide affordable education, and promote Open Source values. There are several sessions and tracks so be sure to look at all the details on the [DevNexus CFP page](https://devnexus.com/cfp-details.html).

### Other Events
Other RDO events, including the many OpenStack meetups around the world, are always listed on the [RDO events page](http://rdoproject.org/events). If you have an RDO-related event, please feel free to add it by submitting a pull request [on Github](https://github.com/OSAS/rh-events/blob/master/2018/RDO-Meetups.yml).
