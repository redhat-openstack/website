### The Future of the RDO Community
Just in case you might have any further questions regarding [IBM’s acquisition of Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/ibm-acquire-red-hat-completely-changing-cloud-landscape-and-becoming-worlds-1-hybrid-cloud-provider), especially with regards to the RDO Community, Brian Proffitt published an article to focus on how [some are wondering what this acquisition will mean for the many upstream projects in which Red Hat participates and sponsors](https://community.redhat.com/blog/2018/11/for-communities-ibm-red-hat-means-stronger-commitment/).

### Community Meetings
Every Wednesday at 15:00 UTC, we have the weekly RDO community meeting on the #RDO channel on Freenode IRC. The agenda for this meeting is posted each week in a [public etherpad](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/RDO-Meeting) and the minutes from the meeting are posted [on the RDO website](https://www.rdoproject.org/community/community-meeting/). If there's something you'd like to see happen in RDO - a package that is missing, a tool that you'd like to see included, or a change in how things are governed - this is the best time and place to help make that happen.

Every Thursday at 15:00 UTC, there is a weekly **CentOS Cloud SIG meeting** on the #centos-devel channel on Freenode IRC. The agenda for this meeting is posted each week in a [public etherpad](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/centos-cloud-sig) and the minutes from the meeting are posted [on the RDO website](https://www.rdoproject.org/contribute/cloud-sig-meeting/). This meeting makes sense for people that are involved in packaging OpenStack for CentOS and for people that are packaging OTHER cloud infra thingies (OpenNebula, CloudStack, Euca, etc) for CentOS. “Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.” - Helen Keller

### Call For Papers
There are a handful of relevant conferences with open CFPs. Need help figuring out a good topic or finalizing your abstract? Feel free to reach out in the #RDO channel on IRC.

* **Red Hat Summit Boston Massachusetts USA 07-09 May 2019** Share your ideas with thousands of open source enthusiasts by submitting a session for [Red Hat Summit 2019](https://www.redhat.com/en/summit/2019). There's a lot going on in open source, and we need your help to talk about it. Please submit an abstract based on one of the topics we will feature this year. [CFP closes 19 November 2018 23:59 UTC](https://rhsummit2019.eventpoint.com/)

* **ServerlessDays Amsterdam The Netherlands 29 March 2019** [ServerlessDays](https://serverlessdays.nl/) started life as JeffConf, a tongue in cheek conference in the spirit of Paul Johnston’s blog post, “Serverless is just a name. We could have called it Jeff”, an attempt to move beyond the Serverless buzzword and focus on the practical use of function as a service platforms and the value they provide. It is a one day, community focused, single track event centred on real world Serverless based solutions. It’s about fostering a community and helping all of us learn from each other as we embrace a new way of building applications. [CFP closes at November 26, 2018 23:11 UTC](https://www.papercall.io/serverless-ams-2019)

* **Open Source Data Center Conference Berlin Germany 14-15 May 2019** Innovative strategies, forward-looking developments and new perspectives in dealing with complex data centers are welcome topics of [OSDC](https://osdc.de/). The international conference is especially adapted to experienced administrators and architects. [CFP closes at  January 31, 2019 12:01 UTC](https://www.papercall.io/osdc)
