### Community Meetings
Every Wednesday at 15:00 UTC, we have the weekly RDO community meeting on the #RDO channel on Freenode IRC. The agenda for this meeting is posted each week in a [public etherpad](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/RDO-Meeting) and the minutes from the meeting are posted [on the RDO website](https://www.rdoproject.org/community/community-meeting/). If there's something you'd like to see happen in RDO - a package that is missing, a tool that you'd like to see included, or a change in how things are governed - this is the best time and place to help make that happen.

Every Thursday at 15:00 UTC, there is a weekly **CentOS Cloud SIG meeting** on the #centos-devel channel on Freenode IRC. The agenda for this meeting is posted each week in a [public etherpad](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/centos-cloud-sig) and the minutes from the meeting are posted [on the RDO website](https://www.rdoproject.org/contribute/cloud-sig-meeting/). This meeting makes sense for people that are involved in packaging OpenStack for CentOS and for people that are packaging OTHER cloud infra thingies (OpenNebula, CloudStack, Euca, etc) for CentOS. “Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.” - Helen Keller

* After receiving and incorporating feedback from the Board of Directors committee, OSF project leadership bodies and the broader community, a draft of the OSF Project Confirmation Guidelines will be reviewed by the Board during their March 5 meeting. We would like to give special thanks to Allison Randal for driving this effort.

### Do You Like METAL?
The OpenStack community just launched a new Bare Metal Special Interest Group, with a focus on highlighting the many ways that OpenStack Ironic is being used in production to manage hardware clusters. The SIG has just started a white paper covering the philosophy and use cases for managing hardware with Ironic. This is a community-based collaboration and you’re invited to participate in writing it!
