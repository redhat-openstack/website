INTRODUCTION

## <a name="housekeeping"></a>Housekeeping Items
### Volunteers Needed for the RDO Pod at Open Infrastructure Summit Shanghai
We are gearing up for Open Infrastructure Summit Shanghai where we'll have our regular presence within the Red Hat booth. This fall, Red Hat doesn’t have as much space, so we won’t be offering any demos, but we're definitely looking for people to spend their precious free time [answering questions](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/shanghai-summit-community-pod) at the RDO booth. 

If you're attending, please consider spending one or more of your free moments with us. Questions run the gamut from "What's RDO?" to "I found a bug in Neutron and need help troubleshooting it." Of course, you're not expected to know everything and you can always keep IRC open to access the RDO Community for help! Plus, you get cool stuff! If you show up for three or more shifts, we're going to hook you up with an RDO hoodie.

Reach out to Rain Leander on IRC (leanderthal) or email (rain@redhat.com) for more information.

### Relaunching the OpenShift on OpenStack SIG
The principal purpose of the OpenShift on OpenStack Special Interest Group is to discuss, develop and disseminate best practices for deploying and managing OpenShift on OpenStack. Specifically, our mission is to facilitate the sharing of best practices, use cases and lessons learned deploying and managing OpenShift, Red Hat’s Enterprise-ready Kubernetes for Developers on OpenStack. 

If you’re interested in joining the SIG or developing a Briefing, please sign up for updates on [https://commons.openshift.org/sig/OpenshiftOpenstack.html](https://commons.openshift.org/sig/OpenshiftOpenstack.html).

### Community Meetings
Every Tuesday at 15:00 UTC, we have a weekly **TripleO Community meeting** on the #TripleO channel on Freenode IRC. The agenda for this meeting is posted each week in a [public etherpad](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/tripleo-meeting-items). If there's something you'd like to see happen within the TripleO Project, from the quickstart to the dashboard, this is the best time and place to make that happen.

Every Wednesday at 15:00 UTC, we have a weekly **RDO Community meeting** on the #RDO channel on Freenode IRC. The agenda for this meeting is posted each week in a [public etherpad](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/RDO-Meeting) and the minutes from the meeting are posted [on the RDO website](https://www.rdoproject.org/community/community-meeting/). If there's something you'd like to see happen in RDO - a package that is missing, a tool that you'd like to see included, or a change in how things are governed - this is the best time and place to help make that happen.

Every Thursday at 15:00 UTC, there is a weekly **CentOS Cloud SIG meeting** on the #centos-devel channel on Freenode IRC. The agenda for this meeting is posted each week in a [public etherpad](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/centos-cloud-sig) and the minutes from the meeting are posted [on the RDO website](https://www.rdoproject.org/contribute/cloud-sig-meeting/). This meeting makes sense for people that are involved in packaging OpenStack for CentOS and for people that are packaging OTHER cloud infra thingies (OpenNebula, CloudStack, Euca, etc) for CentOS. “Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.” - Helen Keller
