### Community Meetings
Every Wednesday at 15:00 UTC, we have the weekly RDO community meeting on the #RDO channel on Freenode IRC. The agenda for this meeting is posted each week in a [public etherpad](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/RDO-Meeting) and the minutes from the meeting are posted [on the RDO website](https://www.rdoproject.org/community/community-meeting/). If there's something you'd like to see happen in RDO - a package that is missing, a tool that you'd like to see included, or a change in how things are governed - this is the best time and place to help make that happen.

Every Thursday at 15:00 UTC, there is a weekly **CentOS Cloud SIG meeting** on the #centos-devel channel on Freenode IRC. The agenda for this meeting is posted each week in a [public etherpad](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/centos-cloud-sig) and the minutes from the meeting are posted [on the RDO website](https://www.rdoproject.org/contribute/cloud-sig-meeting/). This meeting makes sense for people that are involved in packaging OpenStack for CentOS and for people that are packaging OTHER cloud infra thingies (OpenNebula, CloudStack, Euca, etc) for CentOS. “Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.” - Helen Keller

### Goodbye Stein, Hello Train
OpenStack Stein was recently released but the community is already onboard for the next release, Train, scheduled to arrive in October. At next week’s Summit in Denver, you can join open design discussions at the Forum during the Open Infrastructure Summit. Etherpads will be used for collaborative note-taking during those sessions. Then various contributor teams will take advantage of the Projects Team Gathering event to meet and discuss how to organize the upcoming work.

The process to select community goals for the Train release is almost complete: check out the two proposed cross-team goals (PDF docs generation support and IPv6 testing in the gate) and learn about the proponents driving them.
