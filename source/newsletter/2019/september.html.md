### Community Meetings
Every Wednesday at 15:00 UTC, we have the weekly RDO community meeting on the #RDO channel on Freenode IRC. The agenda for this meeting is posted each week in a [public etherpad](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/RDO-Meeting) and the minutes from the meeting are posted [on the RDO website](https://www.rdoproject.org/community/community-meeting/). If there's something you'd like to see happen in RDO - a package that is missing, a tool that you'd like to see included, or a change in how things are governed - this is the best time and place to help make that happen.

Every Thursday at 15:00 UTC, there is a weekly **CentOS Cloud SIG meeting** on the #centos-devel channel on Freenode IRC. The agenda for this meeting is posted each week in a [public etherpad](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/centos-cloud-sig) and the minutes from the meeting are posted [on the RDO website](https://www.rdoproject.org/contribute/cloud-sig-meeting/). This meeting makes sense for people that are involved in packaging OpenStack for CentOS and for people that are packaging OTHER cloud infra thingies (OpenNebula, CloudStack, Euca, etc) for CentOS. “Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.” - Helen Keller

### A Rose By Any Other Name Would Smell Just As Sweet
The next OpenStack release (planned for October 16) is called Train. But what should be the name of the release after that? Our release naming process calls for a name starting with the letter U, ideally related to a geographic feature close to Shanghai, China. The community proposed several options, and a community poll will soon be opened. Watch out for it!

### Are You Using Nova Compute?
A security vulnerability in Nova Compute has been announced for all current versions, so anyone running it should make sure their deployment is updated with the corresponding release’s fix as soon as possible.
