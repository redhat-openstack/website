# RDO Mentors

It can sometimes be a little intimidating when you first start
contributing to OpenStack. While most of the tickets in the
[EasyFix](https://github.com/redhat-openstack/easyfix) queue have a
designated mentor, you may also wish to find a mentor based on the area
that you're interested in working on.

The following people have indicated that they're willing to mentor you
through your first contributions. Please don't hesitate to ask. (And, if
you're willing to mentor a new contributor, please add your name and/or
IRC nick below.)
