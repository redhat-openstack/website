# RDO Mentors

It can sometimes be a little intimidating when you first start
contributing to OpenStack. While most of the tickets in the
[EasyFix](https://github.com/redhat-openstack/easyfix) queue have a
designated mentor, you may also wish to find a mentor based on the area
that you're interested in working on.

Or, when you arrive on IRC, and ask a question and are greeted with
silence, it can be very useful to know who to ping to get their
attention.

The following people have indicated that they're willing to mentor you
through your first contributions, or answer your questions on particular
topics on IRC. Please don't hesitate to ask. (And, if
you're willing to be on the list, please add your name and/or
IRC nick below.)

Finally, if you want to contribute to the upstream OpenStack community,
there's a similar list called the [OpenStack Upstream
Institute](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/OpenStack_Upstream_Institute).
