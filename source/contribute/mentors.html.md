# RDO Mentors

It can sometimes be a little intimidating when you first start
contributing to OpenStack. While most of the tickets in the
[EasyFix](https://github.com/redhat-openstack/easyfix) queue have a
designated mentor, you may also wish to find a mentor based on the area
that you're interested in working on.

Or, when you arrive on IRC, and ask a question and are greeted with
silence, it can be very useful to know who to ping to get their
attention.

The following people have indicated that they're willing to mentor you
through your first contributions, or answer your questions on particular
topics on IRC. Please don't hesitate to ask. (And, if
you're willing to be on the list, please add your name and/or
IRC nick below.)

Finally, if you want to contribute to the upstream OpenStack community,
there's a similar list called the [OpenStack Upstream
Institute](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/OpenStack_Upstream_Institute).

## Where to ask

Conversations about RDO happen a number of different places on IRC. All
of these channels are on Freenode IRC network.

* #RDO - Any general conversation about RDO, including developer issues
  and user questions.

* #tripleO - Discussion specifically of TripleO. This tends to be fairly
  technical.

* #trystack - Discussion of the [http://trystack.org/](Trystack)
  service.

* #centos-devel - If you have questions about the parts of the RDO
  infrastructure that run in the CentOS Community Build System (cbs),
  this is where you're most likely to get answers.

* #openstack - Remember that RDO is just a small part of a larger
  community. Questions about OpenStack in general, not specifically
  about RDO, should go to the upstream channel.
