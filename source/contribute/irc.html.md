# RDO IRC

## Where?

Conversations about RDO happen a number of different places on IRC. All
of these channels are on Freenode IRC network.

* #RDO - Any general conversation about RDO, including developer issues
  and user questions.

* #tripleO - Discussion specifically of TripleO. This tends to be fairly
  technical.

* #trystack - Discussion of the [http://trystack.org/](Trystack)
  service.

* #centos-devel - If you have questions about the parts of the RDO
  infrastructure that run in the CentOS Community Build System (cbs),
  this is where you're most likely to get answers.

* #openstack - Remember that RDO is just a small part of a larger
  community. Questions about OpenStack in general, not specifically
  about RDO, should go to the upstream channel.

## Who?

Often half the problem is finding who you need to ask your questions, so
that you don't get passed from person to person looking for the expert.

that you can ping them directly.
