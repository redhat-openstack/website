# RDO-Bug Triage

## BUG TRIAGE DAY

We generally try to conduct a public bug triage every third Tuesday of the month at 14:00 UTC. That's `date -d "14:00 UTC"` in your local timezone. Please feel free to stop by `#rdo` on IRC (Freenode) to help out or ask questions.

## Bugzilla queries

*   List of un-triaged bugs (NEW state) -- <http://goo.gl/NqW2LN>
*   List of all ASSIGNED bugs (with and without Keyword 'Triaged') -- <http://goo.gl/oFY9vX>
*   List of all ON_QA bugs -- <http://goo.gl/CZX92r>

## Bugzilla workflow

### Initial Triage

Since RDO (say a mid-stream? ) is akin to what Fedora is to RHEL, we try to follow the Fedora bug triage method (see *References* section below) while closely monitoring upstream OpenStack issue tracker (details below in *Upstream OpenStack bug triage* section).

If a bug/RFE has already been fixed in the *current* stable RDO release (say Mitaka), then:

*   Update the "Fixed In Version" field with the NVR (Name-Version-Release) of the package.
*   Move the bug to CLOSED->CURRENTRELEASE.
