### IRC channels

Come chat in real-time with RDO users on **IRC** on the [OFTC](http://oftc.net) server:

* **#rdo**: Any general conversation about RDO, including developer issues and user questions. ([Transcripts.](http://eavesdrop.openstack.org/irclogs/%23rdo/))

* **#openstack**: Remember that RDO is just a small part of a larger community. Questions about OpenStack in general, not specifically about RDO, should go to the upstream channel. ([Transcripts.](http://eavesdrop.openstack.org/irclogs/%23openstack/))


Come chat in real-time with the CentOS Cloud SIG  on **IRC** on the [Libera Chat](http://libera.chat) server:

* **#centos-cloud**: If you have questions about the CentOS [Cloud Special Interest Group (SIG)](https://wiki.centos.org/SpecialInterestGroup/Cloud) and the parts of the RDO infrastructure that run in the CentOS Community Build System (cbs), this is where you're most likely to get answers.
* **#centos-devel**: If you have questions about the CentOS Project

### IRC meetings

We have weekly IRC meetings you can participate in:

* [RDO meetings @ every Wednesday at 14:00 UTC on #rdo on OFTC](/contribute/community-meeting)
* [CentOS Cloud SIG meetings on the second Thursday of the month at 15:00 UTC on #centos-meeting on Libera Chat](https://sigs.centos.org/cloud/communication/meetings/)

### Events

*   Please [search](/search/) first to check if there is a similar page which you can update.
*   Use sentence case for page titles and headings. [Get involved](/contribute/) is correct, [Get Involved](/contribute/) is not.
*   Please keep the website content connected! When you add a new page, add a link to it from the appropriate page(s).
*   Please be aware of our [terms of use](/legal/terms-of-use/) — among other things, you agree to license your contributions under the [Creative Commons Attribution License version 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/), and you agree not to submit illegal content.
