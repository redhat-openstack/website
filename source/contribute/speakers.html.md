# RDO Speakers

If you are willing to be contacted to speak on RDO topics, or on any
OpenStack topic, please update your listing on [OpenStack Foundation speakers
bureau](https://www.openstack.org/community/speakers/). We can often
provide some assistance in travel to nearby events, as well as providing
RDO swag to take with you. [Contact Rich](mailto:rbowen@redhat.com) for
details.

If you are looking for speakers for your meetup group, you can [search
there for 'RDO'](https://www.openstack.org/community/speakers/results?search_query=RDO).
