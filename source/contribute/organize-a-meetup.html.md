# Organize an RDO/OpenStack Meetup

A fan of RDO and OpenStack? Want to spread the word? Become a co-organizer of an OpenStack meetup!

There are OpenStack meetup groups all over the world, with more forming all the time. If there isn't a meetup in your area, we encourage you to start your own. We are committed to the success of these groups, and will do everything in our power to make your OpenStack meetup a successful one.

### Organizing an OpenStack Meetup: The Playbook

#### Step 1: Find an existing meetup

Check the list of [current OpenStack meetups](http://www.meetup.com/find/events/?allMeetups=false&keywords=OpenStack&radius=Infinity&userFreeform=Lexington%2C+KY&mcId=z40502&eventFilter=all). If there's already a meet-up in your area, join it and help to spread the word.

#### Step 2: Create a group on meetup.com

No OpenStack meetup in your area? Create one on [meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/) and [tell us about it](mailto:rdo-list@redhat.com)! Start getting the word out to people in your area. It's a good idea to create a Twitter account to go along with the Meetup, and tell us about that, too, so that we can follow you and retweet your announcements.

#### Step 3: Find a time and place

Secure a date and location for your first meetup! We will help you by spreading the word on social media, reaching out to potential speakers and sponsors in your area, and suggesting new and interesting OpenStack content on a regular basis. Connect with local businesses to see if they've got space, and if they're willing to sponsor refreshments to help bring people in.

### Supporting Your Local OpenStack Meetup

Already an OpenStack meetup group in your area? There are a number of ways you can help.

If you are an experienced user, consider giving a talk. Sharing expertise is what makes meetups so valuable. Even if you're never given a presentation before, there are dozens of OpenStack presentations in the wild, given by other OpenStack users, that can serve as models for your own presentation.

If you are an enthusiast, participate actively in your local meetup. Ask good questions. Help spread the word. Share pictures. Tweet about what you're learning, or write a blog post.

If you are a business, consider hosting or sponsoring. Meetups don't happen without places to have them, and everyone appreciates food at a meetup. It's also a good way to get your company's name out there as an innovative workplace that encourages and supports open source development. If you'd like to host, send us an email and we will put you in touch with OpenStack enthusiasts in your area.
