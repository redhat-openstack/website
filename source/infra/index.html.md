# RDO Infrastructure

RDO is a packaging effort, but this involves a number of infrastructure
components, including CI, this website, and package repositories, among
other things. Here's what it all looks like. See also [this blog
post](https://www.rdoproject.org/blog/2016/07/improving-the-rdo-trunk-infrastructure/)

## www

[This site](http://rdoproject.org/).

## RDO Trunk

RDO Trunk, aka DLRN, aka Delorean. Builds upstream trunk to RDO packages. Its infrastructure
is composed of several servers:

* A private build server, running inside the ci.centos.org infrastructure.
* A public server, [trunk.rdoproject.org](http://trunk.rdoproject.org), hosting the repositories.
* A database server, running in the RDO Cloud (dlrn-db.rdoproject.org).
* A slave database server, which mirrors the main database and also serves as offsite backup server
  for other services (backup.rdoproject.org).

## Code Review and CI

The RDO Gerrit instance is running at [review.rdoproject.org](https://review.rdoproject.org/). It makes use
of a pool of VMs for CI managed by nodepool and running on the RDO Cloud.

The review.rdoproject.org configuration is managed by the [infrastructure core administrators](/infra/review-rdo-infra-core).

Some additional pieces of infrastructure used for CI are:

* [images.rdoproject.org](https://images.rdoproject.org/master/rdo_trunk/) store disk images used by the TripleO CI.

## Blogs

Wordpress blog site for RDO engineers.
[blogs.rdoproject.org](http://blogs.rdoproject.org/)

## Dashboards

High-level status dashboards for the RDO project.
[dashboards.rdoproject.org](https://dashboards.rdoproject.org/rdo-dev)

## Planet

A subset of the planet.openstack.org, tracks RDO bloggers.
[planet.rdoproject.org](http://planet.rdoproject.org/)

## Code

The code lives on several organizations at GitHub:

* [Package specs](https://github.com/rdo-packages)
* [Infrastructure definition and CI](https://github.com/rdo-infra)
* [Website, rdoinfo and others](https://github.com/redhat-openstack)

## Processes and maintenance windows

Refer to the [service continuity page](/infra/service-continuity) for details on our service continuity plans.

The [infrastructure maintenance window](/infra/maintenance-windows) page provides information on our planned
maintenance windows.

## CentOS

A number of parts of our infrastructure run at CentOS, including

* [Mirroring](/documentation/package-list)
* [CI](https://ci.centos.org/view/rdo/view/promotion-pipeline/)
* [CentOS Cloud SIG](https://wiki.centos.org/SpecialInterestGroup/Cloud)
  (not infrastructure, but governance/process)
