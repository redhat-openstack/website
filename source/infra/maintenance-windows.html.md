# Introduction

Infrastructure systems require regular maintenance to ensure a proper, bug-free operation, and the RDO Infrastructure is no exception.
This document defines the processes we will follow to run maintenance on the RDO systems.

## Unplanned maintenance

Unplanned outages may come at any time, due to software/hardware errors or any other circumstance that requires a quick change on a
system to restore its operational state. We will communicate unplanned maintenances as soon as possible, keeping in mind that the
first priority is to restore service.

## Planned maintenance

Planned maintenance includes any change that requires service downtime, but can be scheduled. We define two maintenance windows for
our systems:

- The first Tuesday of each month.
- The third Tuesday of each month.

Having a maintenance window does not necessarily mean all systems will be stopped. If a system requires downtime during one of these
windows, we will notify it at least 24 hours in advance. Communications will be sent to **dev@lists.rdoproject.org**,
**users@lists.rdoproject.org**, and other lists if appropriate.
