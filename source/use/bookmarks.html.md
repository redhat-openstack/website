# RDO/OpenStack Cheatsheet Bookmarks

We've created a number of cheatsheet bookmarks covering common tasks.
You're welcome to print these for your meetups and other events. Or, if
you'd like for us to send you some, please contact
<strong>rain@redhat.com</strong> at least two weeks before your event
with the number that you require, and a shipping address.
