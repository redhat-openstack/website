# Release-Cadence

## RDO packaging release cadence

This page describes the release cadence of RDO packages in relation to different community distributions, giving an approximate idea of "community support" status of any given OpenStack release.

### Fedora

OpenStack upstream, much like Fedora, has a 6-month (approx) release cycle.

RDO packages follow (roughly) the Fedora distribution release schedule. I.e., once N+2 (Juno) is released, we EOL N (Havana). To map Fedora and OpenStack releases in Fedora official repos:

|-----------|-------------------|-----------|
| Fedora 20 | Havana (2013.2)   | EOL       |
| Fedora 21 | Icehouse (2014.1) | supported |
| Fedora 22 | Juno (2014.2)     | supported |

### CentOS
