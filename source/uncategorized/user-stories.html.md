[CERN](http://openstack-in-production.blogspot.com/) has more than 50,000 cores running OpenStack using RDO for deployment.

*We use the RDO client packages on our Linux machines. The upgrade was a change of repository and yum update.* -- [OpenStack In Production blog](http://openstack-in-production.blogspot.com/)

"[A co-worker] and I have been spiking out OpenStack and out of all the Distro's available, without any doubt (obviously as it's from Redhat) RDO is the best for the following reasons:-"

1.  "Idempotent"
2.  "Best Documentation"
3.  "Helpful forums providing working solutions."

"The work done on Packstack is admirable, this makes us to wonder why someone would want to use DevStack."
