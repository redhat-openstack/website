# Neutron GBP

Group Based Policy (GBP) is an optional service plugin for Neutron that provides declarative abstractions for achieving scalable intent-based infrastructure automation. GBP complements the OpenStack networking model with the notion of policies that can be applied between groups of network endpoints.

## GBP Status

Group Based Policy is currently being developed in StackForge as an add-on to the Juno release of Neutron, along with a supporting client library and Horizon and Heat integration. See the [GBP project wiki](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/GroupBasedPolicy) for upstream details. This page describes packaging of GBP for Fedora that is currently under review. As soon as that process is complete, RDO packages will be provided.

## Configuring GBP

*These instructions are preliminary, and the referenced RPMs are unofficial builds not yet included in Fedora. The information here intended to facilitate the Fedora review process. Use at your own risk!!!*

Start with a working packstack installation with neutron on Fedora 20 x86_64, such as described in [Quickstart](Quickstart).

Work in progress...
