# Meetup Assistance

We can help with your OpenStack Meetup in a number of ways.

## What you get

Here's what we can do to help out your OpenStack Meetup:

### Swag

We can ship RDO swag to your meetup location if you give us two weeks
notice. We've got RDO stickers, bookmarks, and potentially more with
more notice. Sometimes there's tshirts left over from events,
[ducks](https://www.rdoproject.org/blog/2015/10/ducks/), and more.

### Speakers

If you have a meetup, and are looking for speakers, we can help make the
connection between your group and local experts. Our OpenStack engineers
are around the world, and we also have strong ties to related
communities - [Ceph](http://ceph.com/),
[OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/),
[OPNFV](https://www.opnfv.org/), [CentOS](http://centos.org), and many
others - who can supply speakers.

### Travel assistance

In certain circumstances, we can provide travel assistance to bring a
speaker to your meetup. Usually this is in-state (in the US), or short
train trips (in Europe), or perhaps someone who is already attending an
event in a nearby venue.

### Promotion

Always, we can provide promotion of your event, through our various
social media outlets, and those of our related communities. With
sufficient notice, we can mention your event in our monthly newsletter,
and publish blog posts on one or more sites.

## What we want

If we help with your meetup, we want something in return. Fortunately,
it's not much.

We'd like to hear back from you about how the event went. How many
people were there? Did you get any good user stories that you can share
with us? An event report on your blog would be ideal.

Please try to take a few photos, so that we can see what the turn out
was like.

And mention #RDOCommunity when you tweet about your event.

## How to get it

If you run a meetup, or if you're going to be speaking at a meetup,
