# RDO Doc Days

We periodically run RDO Doc Days, when we encourage people to improve
the documentation and the website by spending an hour or two looking for
errors, outdated information, or anything else that could be better.

Goals for a doc day include:

* Knock out as many of the [open issues](https://github.com/redhat-openstack/website/issues) as possible.
* Identify docs that are outdated, and/or refer to end-of-lifed releases.
* Consolidate duplicate docs.
* Improve the [test day instructions](https://www.rdoproject.org/testday/tests/), so that people don't have to be experts to participate.

Meanwhile, you can always work on the [open issues](https://github.com/redhat-openstack/website/issues).
