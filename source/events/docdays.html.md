# RDO Doc Days

We periodically run RDO Doc Days, when we encourage people to improve
the documentation and the website by spending an hour or two looking for
errors, outdated information, or anything else that could be better.

The next doc sprint day will be on **March 3rd**, and we'll be polishing
up the docs in anticipation of the Mitaka release.  

Meanwhile, you can always work on the [open issues](https://github.com/redhat-openstack/website/issues).
