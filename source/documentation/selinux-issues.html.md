# SELinux issues

## Troubleshooting SELinux issues

### General tips

SELinux can sometimes be a source of issues with OpenStack. On a system with SELinux enabled (as it is by default on Fedora and RHEL), you can check for denial messages with the command:

    sudo cat /var/log/audit/audit.log | grep -i avc

or

    sudo sealert -a /var/log/audit/audit.log

You can check the SELinux enforcement status of your machine with the command "sestatus" and can temporarily place SELinux in enforcing (in which it blocks access violations) or permissive (logs access violations, but does not block) with the commands "setenforce 1" and "setenforce 0", respectively.

To make SELinux enforcement changes that persist between reboots, edit the file /etc/selinux/config.

To see what the current security context for a resource ls, run

    ls -Z

For more information on SELinux troubleshooting, see <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SELinux/Troubleshooting>.

### Filing Bugzillas

Sometimes, there are missing policies required in order released RDO versions to work correctly with SELinux in enforcing mode. In order for the RDO developers to troubleshoot the problem, please perform the following:

*   Set SELinux to permissive mode
*   Zero out your /var/log/audit/audit.log:
        sudo cp /dev/null /var/log/audit/audit.log

*   Perform a full test of the use case that is causing the problem
*   File a [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.redhat.com) and attach your /var/log/audit/audit.log
    -   When using Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 or CentOS 6, please file the bug against the [openstack-selinux component in RDO](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?component=openstack-selinux&product=RDO).
    -   When using Fedora, please file the bug against [selinux-policy component in Fedora](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?component=selinux-policy&product=Fedora).

For more information about how SELinux policies are developed for RDO, see [SELinux](/install/selinux/)

### PackStack fails if SELinux is disabled

It has been reported that [PackStack will fail if SELinux is disabled](http://{{SERVERNAME}}/forum/discussion/46/install-on-centos-6-4-and-selinux-disabled/p1).

The error observed is:

    ERROR : Error during puppet run : err: /Stage[main]//Exec[setenforce 0]/returns: 
    change from notrun to 0 failed: setenforce 0 returned 1 instead of one of [0] 
    at /var/tmp/packstack/51a57c45478b4091b2eb6a1bbd4c2303/manifests/my_public_ip_ring_swift.pp:56
    Please check log file /var/tmp/packstack/20130421-002212-fYYLUA/openstack-setup.log for more information

The solution is to enable SELinux in permissive mode (if there is a reason not to have it in enforcing mode). In

    /etc/selinux/config

set

    SELINUX=permissive

If you have previously disabled SELinux, you will need to re-label the filesystem, since when SELinux is disabled, this does not happen for new files, and failing to relabel will likely cause many false positive issues. The easiest way to do that is to do the following as root:

    touch /.autorelabel
    reboot

This issue is being tracked in [Red Hat Bugzilla bug #954188](http://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=954188)
