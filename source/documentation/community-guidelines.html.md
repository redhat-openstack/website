# Community guidelines

To ensure that the RDO community is a fun and productive place to come and learn about OpenStack, we have some guidelines for how we expect our community members to behave. Please be respectful of your fellow RDO members, OpenStack developers and users alike.

## Be involved

The RDO community's growth and prosperity depends on each one of us contributing our skills and knowledge for each other's benefit. Take time to ask and answer questions in the forums or on IRC, propose topics for the RDO community blog, talk about RDO at events, etc. By sharing our collective wisdom widely, we all benefit.

If you would are interested in starting an RDO user group, sharing your stories on the community blog or just want to talk to the folks at Red Hat working on RDO, [[drop us a line](mailto://rdo-info@redhat.com).

## Be helpful

The purpose of the RDO site is to give users of Red Hat's Distribution of OpenStack a location to gather, share knowledge and enhance our knowledge of OpenStack. Please help your fellow users with questions as much as you are able to do so, and share as much detailed information as you can, e.g. links to further details are always welcome and appreciated.

## Be polite

We are a global community of developers and users, and we want to create a productive environment where we can all learn together. Please keep discussions on topic and the tone of your posts professional.

## We're here for you

Communication with a global community can be richly rewarding and, at times, problematic. That's OK - we're here to help. If you're having any difficulties communicating effectively with your fellow users, please [[drop us a line](mailto://rdo-info@redhat.com).
