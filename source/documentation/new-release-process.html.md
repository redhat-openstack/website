# New release process - step by step

Creating new release in RDO is quite complex process full of dependencies. This overview is created to give to users and contributors an idea, how it is proceeded and what are detailed steps to perform before new release. Not all steps are frozen in the sequence, but our experience shows that this is most efficient way of working.  Some steps may be done in parallel.

### 1. Create CBS tags for next release

At the very beginning new CBS tag should be created. It is needed before performing a switch to new master. This operation is performed by creating a bug on [pagure.io/centos-infra](https://pagure.io/centos-infra). The example can be found [here](https://pagure.io/centos-infra/issue/912).

### 2. Prepare new DLRN trunk builder.

DLRN builder is an instance, where all packages are build and published as various types of repositories (follow articles about [RDO Trunk repos](https://www.rdoproject.org/what/trunk-repos/) and [RDO CloudSIG repos](https://www.rdoproject.org/what/repos/)). Before we start working on new packages, we have to set the builder. The first step is a change in [rdo-infra/ansible-role-dlrn](https://github.com/rdo-infra/ansible-role-dlrn/), where we define new repositories for builder, as an [example](https://review.rdoproject.org/r/c/rdo-infra/ansible-role-dlrn/+/47053). Second step is to actual definition of new builder in [sf-infra](https://softwarefactory-project.io/r/c/software-factory/sf-infra/+/27459). A patch to sf-infra has to depend on previous one from [ansible-role-dlrn](https://review.rdoproject.org/r/c/rdo-infra/ansible-role-dlrn/+/47053).


### 3. Bootstrapping

Once the dlrn builder is ready, the bootstrap process can be started. This process is about building all dlrn packages in proper sequence. Building is automated, but due to dependencies it has to be restarted several times, also sometimes fixes in spec files are necessary.

Before starting building process, some steps has to be performed on builder:
1. Create de database, users and tablesS
2. Set up authentication from trunk8 host to trunk.rdoproject.org
3. Synchornize deps


### 4. Enable usual operations for the new DLRN Trunk builder
The new builder, to be fully operated, needs to have enabled operations which were not possible before bootstrapping. Examples can be found in [sf-infra](https://softwarefactory-project.io/r/c/software-factory/sf-infra/+/27702) and [ansible-role-dlrn](https://review.rdoproject.org/r/c/rdo-infra/ansible-role-dlrn/+/47529).

This operation will enable building new packages in builders with any new commit in projects (operated by cron), enable triggering automated gerrit reviews in case of [FTBFS](https://www.rdoproject.org/documentation/package-building-overview/#FTBFS) and set new builder visible on [trunk.rdoproject.org](https://trunk.rdoproject.org/) website.

### 5. Enable gerritbot notifications in #rdo channel
 It is very useful to have notification about new changes presented in #rdo irc channel. It can be done by adding:

	c9s-<RDO_NEXT_RELEASE>-rdo

to  gerritbot/channels.yaml in config repo, as an [example](https://review.rdoproject.org/r/c/config/+/47915).

### 6. Requirement check - reqcheck

Most of projects we are packaging are constantly being developed, so their requirements can change - added, removed, in new version or constrained. This check is being done manually, using [rdopkg reqcheck](https://github.com/softwarefactory-project/rdopkg) tool. First libs and client packages are reqchecked, then core packages (like openstack-nova).


Even though the process seems to be not complicated, the appearing issues are often connected with missing dependencies.

Example requirement check can be found [here](https://review.rdoproject.org/r/c/openstack/barbican-distgit/+/47395).

### 7. Build libs, clients and core projects on CBS

Once requirement check is done, next stage can be performed - building. This stage requires following steps:

1. Cut rpm-master branch of distgit repo to create the \<release\>-rdo branch. This can be done with branching [script](https://github.com/rdo-infra/releng/blob/master/scripts/new_release_scripts/branch_projects.sh) from releng tooling or manualy by modifying [config](https://review.rdoproject.org/r/q/project:config) repo.
2. Submit review with new version - a helpful [script](https://github.com/rdo-infra/releng/blob/master/scripts/new_release_scripts/send_new_version.sh).


### 8. Build non-OpenStack puppet modules
Non-OpenStack modules has to be pin to last promoted hash, since they are stable release and can't follow master. They are not following OpenStack release timelines, so they are handled differently. The package has to be build basing on commit snapshot. This operation has to be done with cooperation with p-o-i team (i.e @tkajinam) â€“ these modules can be pinned after p-o-i team confirmation.

1. Pin non OpenStack puppet modules, as [example](https://review.rdoproject.org/r/c/rdoinfo/+/40812), using releng [script](https://github.com/rdo-infra/releng/blob/master/scripts/new_release_scripts/pin-non_os-puppet.sh).
2. Cut branches, as in this [review](https://review.rdoproject.org/r/c/config/+/40859).
3. Build, with releng [script](https://github.com/rdo-infra/releng/blob/master/scripts/new_release_scripts/create_build_snap.sh).

### 9. Move master RDO Trunk to next release tags

Rdoinfo buildsys-tags and tags can be moved to next-release after openstack/requirements being branched. As in [review](https://review.rdoproject.org/r/c/rdoinfo/+/47877) and [review](https://review.rdoproject.org/r/c/rdoinfo/+/47880).


### 10. Build OpenStack puppet modules

There is a bot which will automatically send the update reviews. To trigger this step, we have to branch the distgit projects before upstream p-o-i project create releases for the OpenStack puppet modules.


### 11. Build tempest and the plugins projects

Following steps are required to perform this operation:

1. Branch and build the tempest package with bootstrap mode enabled, as [here](https://review.rdoproject.org/r/c/openstack/tempest-distgit/+/45062)
2. Disable the bootstrap mode without bumping release, to make possibility building other plugins - [example](https://review.rdoproject.org/r/c/openstack/tempest-distgit/+/45203)
3. Cut branches, as in this [review](https://review.rdoproject.org/r/c/config/+/45313)
4. Pin tempest plugins in [rdoinfo](https://review.rdoproject.org/r/c/rdoinfo/+/45314)
5. Review automatically created reviews
6. [Update](https://review.rdoproject.org/r/c/openstack/tempest-distgit/+/45418) version of tempest plugin project


### 12. Create the puppet promotion pipeline

Puppet promotion pipelines has to be defined as in [patchset](https://review.rdoproject.org/r/c/rdo-jobs/+/45355). Tests can be performed using [testinfo](https://review.rdoproject.org/r/c/testproject/+/31972).
Newly defined jobs have to be assigned to project - [example](https://review.rdoproject.org/r/c/config/+/45383).

### 13. Create the next release branch for dependencies
As development of dependencies is still ongoing, new branch has to be prepared for featuring builds - as in this [review](https://review.rdoproject.org/r/c/config/+/45467).

New branch have to be created in upstream [requirements](https://github.com/openstack/requirements/) repo to complete this task.

### 14. Add support of the new release in ansible-role-weirdo-puppet-openstack

### 15. Create the rdo-release RPM

### 16. Create weirdo jobs to promote to -release tag

Following jobs has to be defined in [rdo-jobs repo](https://review.rdoproject.org/r/c/rdo-jobs/+/45782). Such jobs will be triggered whenever promoting package to -release tag.


### 17. Add the new release to dashboards

Currently there are three dashboards to update with new release:

1. [rdo-dev dashboard](https://review.rdoproject.org/r/c/rdo-infra/rdo-dashboards/+/48199)
2. [Promotion dashboard](https://review.rdoproject.org/r/c/rdo-infra/ci-config/+/48196)
3. [FTBFS dashboard](https://review.rdoproject.org/r/c/rdo-infra/releng/+/47596)


### 18.  Enable remaining monitoring on Grafana

Also monitoring other than dashboards should be activated for new release: [Prometheus](https://softwarefactory-project.io/r/c/software-factory/sf-infra/+/26500) and [Grafana](https://softwarefactory-project.io/r/c/software-factory/sf-infra/+/26925).

### 19. Unpin non OpenStack puppet modules and tempest plugins

After the release, these projects can go back to active master following. To do so, they have to be unpin in [rdoinfo](https://review.rdoproject.org/r/c/rdoinfo/+/42313).
