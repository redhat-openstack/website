## Packager onboarding guide

Welcome on board!. As new packager there are some things that you must do to
get ready:

1. Join our [mailing list](/community/mailing-lists/)
2. You can introduce yourself sending a mail to the mailing list. Tell us what are your
interests and how you will participate.
3. Joining our IRC channel #rdo in freenode is a good way to get in touch with other packagers.
4. Create your account in [RDO SoftwareFactory](https://review.rdoproject.org/auth/login).
You need a [github](https://github.com) account which is used to log in.
5. Read our [RDO packaging introduction](/documentation/intro-packaging/). It provides some
interesting information for newcomers.
6. Install [rdopkg](/documentation/intro-packaging/#rdopkg) tool, you'll need it!
7. You can start getting familiar with RDO by reviewing patches in [RDO Gerrit instance](https://review.rdoproject.org/r)
or by sending your own patches for existing packages.
8. If you want to become maintainer for one or more packages, you can request to be added to the
core group for them by sending a review to [rdoinfo](https://github.com/redhat-openstack/rdoinfo/) 
as in [this example](https://review.rdoproject.org/r/#/c/7102/). Being a maintainer for a package
provides the ability to aprove reviews for it (grants +2 and +W in gerrit terms).
