### Create a GitHub account
Go to the [GitHub Sign Up](https://github.com/join) page and enter your

### Sign up to `review.rdoproject.org`
Sign-in to [review.rdoproject.org](https://review.rdoproject.org/auth/login)
using your GitHub account.

<a name="add-ssh"/>

### Add an SSH key to `review.rdoproject.org`
* Generate an SSH key, if you don't have one you already use. Follow these
  instructions on [Generating a new SSH key](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/#generating-a-new-ssh-key)
  if necessary.
* Then, go to [ssh-key](https://review.rdoproject.org/r/#/settings/ssh-keys)
  and click on the "Add Key" button and copy the contents of `id_rsa.pub` (your
  SSH public key) and paste it there, and then click on the 'Add' button and
  you are done.

<a name="bugzilla-account"/>

### Create a Red Hat Bugzilla account
All the bugs related to RDO packages are tracked on Red Hat Bugzilla under the
*RDO* product. OpenStack project bugs are tracked on
[Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/openstack).

* You can create a Bugzilla account by clicking on
  [Create a new Red Hat Bugzilla account](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/createaccount.cgi),
  enter your email, and click on the "send" button. Be sure to check your
  mailbox, confirm your email address, and you're done.

<a name="git-review"/>

### Configure `git` and `git review`
* Run these steps to let `git` know your email address:

```
$ git config --global user.name "Firstname Lastname"
$ git config --global user.email "your_email@youremail.com"
```
* To check your `git` configuration:

```
$ git config --list
```

* Install the `git-review` tool

RHEL-based systems (e.g. RHEL7, CentOS 7)
```
$ sudo yum install git-review
```

Fedora-based systems (after F24)
```
$ sudo dnf install git-review
```

<a name="rdopkg"/>

### Install the `rdopkg` tool
Follow this link to install
[rdopkg](https://www.rdoproject.org/documentation/intro-packaging/#rdopkg), and
you are set for making contributions to the RDO Project.

<a name="first-contribution"/>

### Make your first contribution
* The RDO Project has lots of easy fixes. Check out the
  [RDO easyfix](https://github.com/redhat-openstack/easyfix/issues) page, pick
  an issue, and feel free to move ahead.
* Clone the project.

For example, cloning `keystone-distgit`, we need to pass the source code URL.

```
$ git clone https://review.rdoproject.org/r/openstack/keystone-distgit
```

You can also use `rdopkg` to clone an RDO package.

```
$ rdopkg clone package-name
```
* Go inside the project directory, create, and checkout a new branch.
  _Note_: Always create a new branch to work on any issue.

```
$ cd <project_name>
$ git checkout -b <issue name>
```
* Make changes in the code and add the changed files to git.

```
$ git add <chanaged files>
```
* Commit the changes

```
$ git commit -m "Add the commit message"
```
You can check this link on how to write
[proper commit messages](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/GitCommitMessages).

* If something went wrong in the commit message, or you need to adjust it, run
  the following command:

```
$ git commit --amend
```
* Now push the changes for review using `git-review`.

```
$ git review
```

Running `git review` will create an RDO Gerrit review link, and someone from
RDO project will review the changes. Once everything looks fine, and is
approved, your changes will get merged, and you'll have made your first
contribution. Thanks!

### Review RDO patches
* Reviewing other peoples patches is a good way to learn things.
* You can start getting familiar with RDO by reviewing patches in the
  [RDO Gerrit instance](https://review.rdoproject.org/r/) or by sending your
  own patches for existing packages.

### Become an RDO package maintainer
If you want to become a maintainer for one or more packages, you can request to
be added to the core group for them by sending a review to
[rdoinfo](https://github.com/redhat-openstack/rdoinfo/) as in
[this example](https://review.rdoproject.org/r/#/c/7102/).

Being a maintainer for a package provides the ability to approve reviews for it
(grants `+2` and `+W` in Gerrit terms).
