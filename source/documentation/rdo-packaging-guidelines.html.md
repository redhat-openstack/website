# RDO OpenStack Packaging Guidelines

## Introduction

This document collects guidelines and practical tips


## Packaging Guidelines

RDO packages mostly follow [Fedora Packaging Guidelines](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Guidelines).
There are two exceptions:

 * Override rules listed in this document.
 * Exceptions granted by RDO Packaging Group (e.g. bundling)

A set of examples for spec and other useful files can be found in
[openstack-example-spec](https://github.com/openstack-packages/openstack-example-spec) github repository. These files can be used as templates for new packages although
some adjustments may be needed for each particular case.

## Packages Review Process

* All reviews **must** add the alias RDO-{**release**} to the "Blocks" field on the review request BZ.
Each release has a BZ created aliased RDO-{**release**}. For example, for the R release add RDO-ROCKY to the Blocks field on the review request BZ.
To see examples of other BZs that block on a release BZ select one from the block list on [RDO-ROCKY](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=RDO-ROCKY)

* Announcing reviews on the RDO mailing list is encouraged to raise awareness within the
community and speed up the process.

* General-purpose libraries and clients should be submitted through Fedora Package Review
[Process](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Package_Review_Process).

* As for OpenStack services, they should follow the same process but open a ticket under
the **RDO** product and **Package Review** component. Packagers are encouraged to create
a git repository with their packaging for pre-review.

If you are looking for an example of Package Review for RDO project, [here](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/buglist.cgi?bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&classification=Community&component=Package%20Review&list_id=5247140&product=RDO&query_format=advanced)
you have the list of currently open ones.

### For reviewers

Reviewers are encouraged to use fedora-review tool to generate and post formal review
on the ticket.


## RDO Guidelines

### Systemd packaging

* All services must be configured to allow automated restart

```bash
Restart=[on-failure|always]
```
* If a service depends on other for proper start, you can use the `After=` and
optionally `Requires=` parameters in unit configuration file. An example of
dependencies for neutron-openvswitch-agent service:

```bash
After=syslog.target network.target network.service openvswitch.service
Requires=openvswitch.service
```

* The systemd package provides a set of rpm macros to handle systemd operations
on %post, %preun and %postun (more details [here](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Scriptlets#Systemd)).

### python packaging guidelines

* Remove requirements files used by pip to download dependencies from the network.
That may hide missing dependencies or integration issues (e.g. a dependency package only available in an incompatible version)

```bash
  rm -rf {,tests-}requirements.txt
```

* Use versioned python macros everywhere.

### Packages requirements

* Check your package dependencies with ```rdopkg reqcheck```.

* Versions for build requirements are not needed as the latest available version
will be always installed at build time by the packaging tools.

* Actual requirements for default or common configurations of services must be
added as explicit requires.

* Optional requirements for specific configurations must not be added as explicit
requires.

* When versioning of explicit requires is needed be aware that epoch is used in
some RDO packages. In those cases remember to add the epoch in the required
version as in:

```bash
Requires:         python-oslo-config >= 2:2.6.0
```

### Configuration files

* Use oslo-config-generator to generate configuration files.

```bash
oslo-config-generator --config-file=config-generator/keystone.conf
```

* Configuration files must be in /etc and not /usr/etc.

### Tests packaging

OpenStack projects provide different tests including unit tests and functional
tests, typically using the tempest framework.

* Core packages shouldn't include tests as are not required in runtime.

* Unit tests should be included in a &lt;package name>-tests-unit package that
should depend on the test requirements.

* Tempest tests should be included in a &lt;package name>-tests-tempest package
which should depend on the dependencies to run the provided tests. Note that
some projects include tempest tests in the main project git repository (so tempest
package would be a subpackage in the same spec file) while others use a separate
git repository (so a specific distgit and spec will be needed).

* &lt;package name>-tests: includes all tests, and should be a virtual package
requiring &lt;package name>-tests-tempest and &lt;package name>-tests-unit.

### Other considerations

* To enforce consistency accross OpenStack services packages, use the following snippet to set upstream project name.

```bash
%global service keystone
```

RDO project provides different examples specs in
[openstack-example-spec](https://github.com/openstack-packages/openstack-example-spec)
for the different package types (OpenStack service, library, client, dashboard
plugin, etc...). This examples can be used as templates for new packages being
added to RDO repositories.

### Patches

RDO is and intends to remain a vanilla distribution of OpenStack.
Our default policy is to refuse downstream patches, but RDO Packaging Group may grant
exceptions on per-case basis

* Feature patches: must be submitted upstream

* Security patches: requires RDO Security team clearance.

* FTBFS patches: requires peer review, and must be submitted upstream when possible.
