            ## What is RDO?

            {:.floatright}
            ![An Openstack Distribution](openstack-distribution.png)

            RDO is a community of people using and deploying OpenStack on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Fedora and distributions derived from these (such as CentOS, Scientific Linux and others). We have [documentation to help get started](Docs), [Mailing_lists](Mailing_lists) where you can connect with other users, and [community-supported packages](Quickstart) of the most up-to-date OpenStack releases available for download.

            If you are looking for enterprise-level support, or information on partner certification, Red Hat also offers [Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform](//redhat.com/openstack).

            OpenStack relies on the underlying operating system and hypervisor — and what better operating system to build on than the industry's leading enterprise operating system? The RDO community is your one-stop community site for all things related to using OpenStack on Red Hat based platforms.
