          ## What is RDO?

            {:.floatright.openstack-distro}
            ![An Openstack Distribution](openstack-distribution.png)

            RDO is a community of people using and deploying OpenStack on CentOS, Fedora, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux. We have [documentation to help get started](Docs), [Mailing_lists](Mailing_lists) where you can connect with other users, and [community-supported packages](/install/quickstart/) of the most up-to-date OpenStack releases available for download.

            If you are looking for enterprise-level support, or information on partner certification, Red Hat also offers [Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform](//redhat.com/openstack).

            OpenStack relies on the underlying operating system and hypervisor — and what better operating system to build on than the industry's leading enterprise operating system? The RDO community is your one-stop community site for all things related to using OpenStack on Red Hat based platforms.

          ## Get Involved

          There are many ways to [get involved](get involved) with the RDO community once you [ get started](quickstart). The simplest way is to [head over to the ask.openstack.org forum](http://ask.openstack.org) and help answer questions. Or try out OpenStack for your self right now at [TryStack.org](http://trystack.org/).

          The Puppet modules used in packstack are on [Github](https://github.com/packstack) and packstack itself is on [Stackforge](https://github.com/stackforge/packstack).

          For a commercially-supported enterprise ready OpenStack solution, Red Hat provides [Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform](//redhat.com/openstack), an enterprise-class cloud platform based on OpenStack Juno.
