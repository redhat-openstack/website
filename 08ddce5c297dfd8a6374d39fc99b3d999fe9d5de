      "message": "Good to have the release process documented on our website ðŸ’¯\nI think we\u0027ll keep our Jira User Story template (by cloning it release after release) as the primary place to update the workflow, in order to keep agility. Then we\u0027ll have to keep this page up-to-date based on the evolution of the Jira User Story template\nThank you karolinku",
