    OpenStack is a huge cloud computing project, which does not provide
    packaging for platforms – RDO does it for rpm-based Linux distros.
    Delivering packages for such project with new release every half a
    year is a challenging task. In this talk I’d like to bring closer to
    audience our continous-delivery approach to package delivery – starting
    from creating and adding new packages, through updates and managing all
    packages already delivered, share our practice in automation and tips
    how to not get drown in dependencies of dependencies. The journey will
    also have quick stop in building tools we are using in RDO and
    continuous integration to ensure stability and compatibility, to finally
    reach the point of having new OpenStack release. This talk is intended
    not only for those, whose daily duties are connected with cloud or
    continous-delivery technologies, but also for anyone interested in topic
    of delivering packages at great scale in open source cloud project, or
    would like to contribute to RDO.
