 The Project Teams Gathering (PTG) is a new event organized by the OpenStack Foundation. Every six months (Q1 and Q3), at the beginning of the development phase of a release cycle, project teams will meet in person to discuss priorities for the upcoming cycle, iterate quickly on solutions for complex issues, and make fast progress on critical items.
