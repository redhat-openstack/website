    High-performance flash storage like NVMe SSDs are becoming commonplace
    in production environments. In this age of fast storage, inefficiencies
    in storage software stacks that were previously acceptable with slow
    spinning devices, are no longer tolerable. There are even faster
    technologies, like NVDIMMs, on the horizon. These developments are
    particularly challenging for distributed storage solutions like Gluster
    and Ceph, where network latencies are a fact of life. This talk is on
    performance analysis and troubleshooting tools and techniques for this
    age.

    Python 3.0 was released 10 years ago. It's time to look back: analyze
    the migration from Python 2 to Python 3, see the progress we made on
    the language, list bugs by cannot be fixed in Python 2 because of the
    backward compatibility, and discuss if it's time or not to bury Python
    2.

    Python became the defacto language in the scientific world and the
    favorite programming language as the first language to learn
    programming.

  description: |
    This talk will explain the tight relationship between the OpenStack and
    OPNFV communities, using as a base the Cross Community CI project, and
    the benefits that both communities get from it.

    Initially the OPNFV CI was based on the consumption of stable
    artifacts, including stable versions of OpenStack. Developers were not
    able to work with master versions, causing lack of testing and delay on
    delivering projects.

    Cross Community CI project (XCI) enabled testing based on master
    versions of the different upstream components (OpenStack ,
    OpenDaylight...). This caused to significantly cut the time of
    development and identify bugs earlier.

    In this talk we will introduce that concept, and we will also explain
    the tooling used to achieve it (bifrost, openstack-ansible,
    ansible-opendaylight), showing how a deployment goes from end to end,
    how to reuse this project for your own needs, and how to start
    integrating your own project into XCI if that fits into the scope.

    Infinity is a platform-independent system for executables and shared
    libraries to expose functionality to debug, monitoring, and analysis
    tooling. It grew from a need to be able to debug multithreaded
    applications without requiring libthread_db. Other systems exist that
    use the libthread_db paradigm, for example librtld\_db and OPMD;
    Infinity was designed to replace this entire class of library-tool
    interface with something more portable and robust.

    Covers: \* What is Infinity? \* Motivation for creating it \* Status of
    tooling and glibc/GDB integration \* Mini code walk through

    This may come as a surprise but it is already possible to run nested
    KVM inside Hyper-V VMs (and this includes several instance types on
    Azure). Such workloads, however, may not always perform very well. Some
    limitations come from x86 architecture and conceptual differences
    between KVM and Hyper-V, other issues could be dealt with within KVM.
    In this talk Vitaly will go through different performance bottlenecks
    of nested KVM-on-Hyper-V deployments. The presentation will mainly be
    focused on low-level features: hardware support for nested
    virtualization, clocksources and clockevents, virtual device drivers.
    Benchmark data and general thoughts on the usefulness of such
    deployments won't be missing too.

    Software Defined Networking seems to be a natural fit for virtual data
    centers. Centralized management along with flexibility and speed of
    provisioning are traits of both virtualization and SDN. The oVirt team
    aims at making this a reality with OVN, a new network virtualization
    extension to Open vSwitch. The integration is accomplished by the
    "network provider for OVN", which uses OVN through an OpenStack
    Neutron-like API, allowing the use of OVN through Neutron abstractions.
    This concept is already being used in the oVirt project, and there's
    work in progress to implement it in the ManageIQ project

    The session will look into utilising Software Defined Network concepts
    in a virtualization project through the oVirt perspective.

    The presentation will consist of 4 parts: - What is SDN and OVN -
    Overview of the network provider for OVN - Overview of how the provider
    is used in oVirt - Live demo: OVN in oVirt

  description: |
    OpenStack deployments are increasingly embracing distributed file
    storage solutions for virtual servers to provide fault-tolerance,
    mobility, and shared state between servers. The Ceph distributed file
    system (CephFS) has taken aleading role in providing this as a
    cache-coherent, horizontally scalable, and POSIX-compatible file store
    for OpenStack operators, leveraging Ceph's dominance and flexibility in
    OpenStack deployments where it already provides object and block
    storage solutions.

    The OpenStack Shared File Systems service, Manila, provides a modular
    framework for securely exporting file shares to tenants in the cloud.
    In this session we will describe how Manila has been extended to
    support export of shares backed by CephFS via the NFS protocol to
    tenant VMs. We’ll discuss reasons for using NFS instead of or in
    addition to doing native CephFS exports and cover current and planned
    approaches to such issues as multi-tenancy, performance, and scale out
    of services.

    This talk will be of immediate practical interest to cloud operators
    who have or are planning use Ceph clusters for object and block storage
    and want to use the same cluster for shared file services as well as to
    those more generally interested in Manila, distributed file systems, or
    Ceph evolution.

    provide significant advantages for both security and usability and all
    the tools are open source in Linux. Smart cards are no longer only
    credit-card sized cards, but also more practical USB dongles which are

    SSSD is known in the OSS world as a client towards different LDAP-like
    databases. However, recently, we have started taking SSSD beyond its
    bread and butter LDAP client role to provide services that are usable
    in a broader context, as an application gateway or to a local machine.
    As a result, you might soon see SSSD enabled and running in your
    favourite distribution by default or quietly running on the background
    of another service.

    In the talk I will demonstrate what enhancements we already did in
    SSSD, such as how to use SSSD as a gateway between an application and a
    user database or why should you let SSSD manage your Kerberos
    credential caches .

    I'll also illustrate things we are working on for the future such how
    to add and access extra attributes of your local users or why it makes
    sense to let SSSD handle smart card logins even for local users.

    The talk will be useful to system administrators, mainly those who deal
    with user account management, but also to developers who work on
    services that integrate with user databases.

    Declarative systems, like Kubernetes are nice. Instead of forming the
    state of the system command-by-command, one just posts a set of
    declarative requirements. The system will try to adapt. While it easy
    to understand how to use such a system from the user perspective, it
    requires a complete rethinking for us engineers on how to integrate
    with such a system. Based on the experiences with extending Kubernetes
    for KubeVirt with the Kubernetes-Go-SDK, this session gives a short and
    concise overview on what is required to implement declarative flows in
    general and particularly in Kubernetes. Real-world examples and
    pitfalls included.

    (and jcov, asmtools and jtharness) build have been greatly improved -
    there is now a binary build of OpenJDK that can be used as --boot-jdk
    (on Linux x86-64)

    The situation for HotSpot developers has also improved over the years:
    - the HotSpot build system was converted to the "new" build system - a
    proper unit test framework for C++ code (googletest) was added - debug
    symbols are no longer zipped by default - the JDK and HotSpot JTReg
    testlibraries were combined into one

    This talk will show how all these changes make the OpenJDK developer
    experience a lot smoother. The speakers will also share their personal
    tips and tricks on how to work even faster on OpenJDK!

    We also realize that the OpenJDK developer experience is far from
    optimal, and would therefore like this talk to initiate a discussion on
    what could be improved and how people can get involved.

    The MethodHandle API was added in Java 7, as a way to programmatically
    build up smart function pointers. Far more powerful than simple
    reflection, handles JIT and optimize like Java code, producing a fast,
    direct, type-safe callable. And the API has continued to evolve: in
    Java 9, you can now embed atomic semantics, array views, loops and
    "finally" logic, and much more. Come learn how flexible and useful
    MethodHandles can be!

    There's an old joke about a new bride who prepares her first big dinner
    for her new husband. She's making her mother's brisket recipe which
    starts by cutting the ends off of the roast. Her husband asks her why
    she cuts the ends off. She says she does it because that's the way her
    mother always did it. She asks her mother and her mother says "That's
    the way your grandmother always did it". She asks her grandmother and
    her grandmother says "That's the only way it would fit in my pan".
    There's a lot of folklore and myth surrounding Java garbage collection
    performance, most of which is obsolete, irrelevant to your application,
    or was never really right in the first place.

    So how do we evaluate a GC algorithm? We can measure various metrics:
    end to end run time, maximum pause time, average pause time, percentage
    of the cpu given to the Java threads, memory footprint, micro
    benchmarks, ... This talk will focus on ten (give or take)
    metrics/tools we can use to evaluate garbage collection performance.
    This isn't a comparison of OpenJDK collectors, it's a discussion of
    what characteristics are important in a good garbage collector and how
    to measure them.

  description: |
    The OpenJDK JVM eats class bytecode and spits out Java heap objects and
    machine code as part of normal execution. However, the JVM manages more
    data than just bytecode, Java objects JITted code. In order to manage
    heap memory and to ensure correct execution, the JVM and JITted code
    need to retain and, occasionally, interrogate details of the loaded
    class base. Bytecode is not a very 'efficient' representation for this
    purpose, nor does it include details of runtime-derived info like class
    and method implementation dependencies, compile history and JITted code
    status, or execution profiles.

    So, the JVM throws away most bytecode after parsing, in its place
    constructing and maintaining its own 'efficient' in-memory (C++) data
    structures which model both the loaded class and method base and
    runtime-derived state. This is what is known as Class Metadata. Class
    Metadata is a significant component of the Native Memory storage
    allocated and managed by the JVM, alongside JIT Compiler Metadata, GC
    Metadata, Thread Metadata, etc. For small applications that don't
    create a large number of Java objects Metadata can constitute a large
    portion of a Java application's resident memory set.

    This talk will begin by describing how to use the jcmd tool to measure
    summary JVM Native Memory storage costs, including overall Class
    Metadata costs. It will also show how to use jcmd to obtain a detailed
    breakdown of the latter costs, splitting the overheads along two axes:
    firstly, by class; and secondly, dividing per-class costs into separate
    sub-costs associated with different component subsets of the class
    model: classes per se, constant pools, methods and annotations.

    I will go on to explain how Class Metadata is carved out of the memory
    regions managed by the JVM's Native Memory allocation routines and
    detail the memory layout of the various C++ types which define the
    elements of the Class Metadata model, thereby clarifying some of the
    more detailed statistics available in jcmd output. Real-life use cases
    will be employed to explain how specific costs arise from code design
    choices and to suggest how alternative choices might increase or
    decrease Class Metadata costs.

    releases. Swift is a highly available, distributed, eventually
    consistent object store. It is used at organizations like Wikipedia,
    OVH, Ebay and many more across the globe to store lots of data
    efficiently at a massive scale. It provides a RESTful API for data
    access, making it ideal for use with web applications. This talk will

    default because they cause problems on certain devices or in certain,
    often corner-case, circumstances. This talk will describe and look into
    recent efforts to enable more power-saving features by default in such
    a way that this will not cause regressions. The end goal of these
    efforts is to shave of at least 2 watt of the typical idle
    power-consumption of 6-9 watt for recent (Hasswell or newer) laptops.
    The goal is to achieve this saving on an OOTB Fedora Workstation
    install without the user needing to do any manual tweaks.

    As kubernetes clusters take on more workloads, the need for persistent
    storage has only increased. Users want to connect more storage devices
    and use them efficiently. Cinder has been solving this use case in
    Openstack for a long time and can be integrated with any kubernetes
    cluster regardless of its cloud provider. By deploying a standalone
    cinder service and a new external provisioner to a cluster, pods can
    access almost any volume that cinder is able to provision. Complex
    operations such as cloning, snapshots, and migration become services of
    the cluster. This presentation will describe and demonstrate a cinder
    external provisioner, enumerate its advantages, discuss challenges
    especially around deployment, and propose collaboration opportunities

    VMs and containers, such as KubeVirt?

    The talk aims to \* introduce KubeVirt, a Kubernetes add-on to manage
    virtual machines, \* give overview of device assignment in Kubernetes
    and in VM management software oVirt, \* present an idea of combining
    these two.

    Even the best system administrator cannot always avoid any and every
    disaster that may plague his data center, but he should have a
    contingency plan to recover from one - and an administrator that
    manages his virtual data centers with oVirt is of course no different.
    This session will showcase how Ansible can be used to leverage the new
    APIs introduced in oVirt 4.2 to create a fully-fledged DR strategy.
