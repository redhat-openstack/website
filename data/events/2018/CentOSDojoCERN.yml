 The CentOS Dojo's are a one day event, organized around the world, that bring together people from the CentOS Communities to talk about systems administration, best practices in Linux centric activities and emerging technologies of note. The emphasis is to find local speakers and tutors to come together and talk about things that they care about most, and to share stories from their experiences working with CentOS in various scenarios.
